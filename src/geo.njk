            <h2>What is Generative Engine Optimisation?</h2>
            <p>Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) addresses how content appears in AI-generated responses. As AI systems like ChatGPT, Google's AI overviews, and other LLM-powered tools become common information sources, businesses need strategies to be included in these generated responses.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional search where users click through to websites, AI systems often synthesise answers from multiple sources. GEO focuses on making your content a source that AI systems reference and recommend.</p>
            <p>This is an emerging discipline that builds on traditional SEO principles while adapting to the specific behaviours of generative AI systems.</p>

            <h2>How AI Search Systems Work</h2>
            <p>AI-powered search and recommendation systems operate differently from traditional search:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong> AI systems combine information from multiple sources rather than simply ranking pages</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> LLMs interpret meaning and context, not just keyword matching</li>
                <li><strong>Authority Assessment:</strong> AI systems evaluate source credibility based on training data and retrieval signals</li>
                <li><strong>Response Generation:</strong> Answers are constructed dynamically based on the query context</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These differences mean that content must be structured and positioned for AI comprehension and selection.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>GEO Principles</h2>
            <p>Effective GEO is built on several key principles:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Factual Accuracy:</strong> AI systems prefer information that aligns with consensus sources and can be verified</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Content that is clearly written and unambiguous is more likely to be referenced</li>
                <li><strong>Authority:</strong> Established brands and credible sources are preferred in AI recommendations</li>
                <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Original information and perspectives that aren't available elsewhere</li>
                <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Comprehensive coverage of topics that addresses full user intent</li>

            <h2>GEO vs AEO</h2>
            <p>While related, GEO and <a href="/aeo">AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation)</a> address different aspects of AI-influenced search:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>AEO</strong> focuses on appearing in featured snippets and direct answers within traditional search results</li>
                <li><strong>GEO</strong> focuses on being referenced by generative AI systems that create synthesised responses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AEO optimises for extraction—having content pulled into answer boxes. GEO optimises for reference—being a source that AI systems draw upon when generating responses.</p>
            <p>Both disciplines share foundational elements: clear structure, accurate information, and authoritative positioning. Effective strategy typically addresses both.</p>

            <h2>An Emerging Discipline</h2>
            <p>GEO is a new and evolving field. AI systems are changing rapidly, and strategies that work today may need adjustment as these systems develop.</p>
            <p>What remains consistent is the value of high-quality, accurate content from credible sources. Building genuine authority and creating genuinely useful content remains the foundation of visibility across both traditional and AI-powered search.</p>
            <p>GEO should be viewed as an extension of sound <a href="/">SEO Sydney</a> practice rather than a replacement for it.</p>
