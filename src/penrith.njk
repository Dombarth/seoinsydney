<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Penrith and the surrounding areas of Emu Plains, Jamisontown, Kingswood and Werrington. Penrith is the major commercial centre of western Sydney's outer ring. High Street, Henry Street, the Westfield and the surrounding commercial areas support a wide range of businesses serving a large and growing population.</p>

<p>Penrith operates as a regional centre for an area that stretches from the Blue Mountains to St Marys and from Richmond down to Wallacia. Businesses here don't just serve the local suburb — they draw customers from a wide catchment area. That means the search volume for services in Penrith is higher than you'd expect for a suburb this far from the CBD.</p>

<p>We started working with a family law firm on High Street in 2021. They had two solicitors and had been operating for about eight years primarily on referrals and Legal Aid work. They wanted to build their private client base and reduce their reliance on Legal Aid. Their website was a basic template with generic content about family law. We rebuilt the site around their key practice areas — divorce and separation, property settlements, parenting orders, domestic violence, child support — with content that addressed the specific concerns and search behaviour of people going through family law matters. We optimised the GBP, built links from legal directories and associations and created resources targeting the questions people actually search for during these difficult situations. Over about ten months they went from having no organic visibility to ranking for family law searches across the greater Penrith and Blue Mountains area. Their private client enquiries from search went from about two per month to roughly twelve. They've since taken on a third solicitor.</p>

<p>For the trades and construction businesses in Penrith the building boom in western Sydney creates constant demand. Builders, concreters, fencers and landscapers that rank well for Penrith and western Sydney searches have more work than they can handle.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
