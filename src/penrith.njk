suburbContext: |
    <p>Penrith is the regional centre for far western Sydney, situated at the foot of the Blue Mountains. The area serves as the commercial, retail, and entertainment hub for a large surrounding population that extends into the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury regions.</p>
    <p>The business profile includes retail anchored by major shopping centres, trades and construction services, professional services, healthcare, hospitality, and tourism-related businesses leveraging proximity to the mountains.</p>
