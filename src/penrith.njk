<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Penrith and across the greater western Sydney region. We've been working with businesses around High Street, Henry Street, Station Street, the Panthers precinct and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Penrith has become a major regional centre with significant investment in infrastructure, health and education.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Penrith is the commercial capital of western Sydney with a large population catchment extending from the Blue Mountains to St Marys and beyond. Theres a strong concentration of legal firms, medical specialists, real estate agencies, trade businesses, automotive services and a growing hospitality scene. For businesses in Penrith the search volume is substantial because the suburb serves as the destination centre for a massive region. Its a market where the businesses that have invested in SEO hold strong positions and the ones that haven't are missing out on a significant volume of leads.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a conveyancing firm near High Street in early 2022 that had been operating for about six years. Two conveyancers handling residential and commercial property transfers across the greater Penrith area. They were getting most of their work from real estate agent referrals which is where most of their matters had always come from. Their website was a single page with contact details and their Google Business Profile was basic. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages for residential, commercial and off the plan conveyancing, created content around the property transfer process and stamp duty topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from legal directories and property industry publications. Over about eight months their organic enquiries went from about one per month to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the legal content which a lot of other agencies in western Sydney outsource.</p>

<p>The trade and construction market in Penrith is significant given the amount of new housing development in the region. Builders, electricians, plumbers and landscapers who service the Penrith area can build a very strong pipeline of work through local SEO because the population is growing rapidly and the demand for home construction and maintenance services is consistently high.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Penrith businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For legal firms and professional services in Penrith its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many practice areas or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Penrith business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Penrith area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
