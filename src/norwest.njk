<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Norwest and the Norwest Business Park. Norwest has transformed from farmland into one of Sydney's major suburban business hubs. The area around Norwest Boulevard, Columbia Court and the Norwest Marketown supports a significant number of medical specialists, corporate offices, technology companies and professional services firms.</p>

<p>The medical specialist market in Norwest is one of the most competitive in the Hills District. The Norwest Private Hospital and surrounding medical suites have attracted a concentration of specialists — orthopaedic surgeons, obstetricians, cardiologists, dermatologists and more — all serving the growing Hills population. Many of these specialists have relied on GP referrals and haven't invested in their online presence. But the dynamic is shifting as more patients research specialists online before requesting specific referrals from their GP.</p>

<p>We started working with a specialist practice in the Norwest medical precinct in 2022. They had two specialists and were well regarded by referring GPs but had almost no visibility in Google for their specialty terms. Their website was a basic template that listed their qualifications and consulting hours but had no content about the conditions they treated or procedures they performed. We rebuilt the website around individual condition and procedure pages, optimised the GBP with correct specialty categories and built links from medical associations and specialist directories. Over about eight months they went from having no organic visibility to ranking for several of their key procedure terms across the Hills and northwestern Sydney. The practice manager estimated they were receiving about six to eight new patient enquiries per month directly from search which represented a meaningful increase in their patient volume.</p>

<p>For the corporate and professional services businesses in the Norwest Business Park the competition tends to be national rather than local. These businesses often need broader SEO strategies targeting industry specific terms rather than location based searches.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Specialist medical from $1,800. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
