<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Norwest and across the Hills District. We've been working with businesses around Norwest Boulevard, Solent Circuit, Columbia Court and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Norwest has established itself as a significant commercial precinct particularly since the metro line connected it to the broader Sydney network.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Norwest is a purpose built business park and commercial centre with a strong concentration of corporate offices, medical specialists, health facilities and professional services firms. The Norwest Private Hospital and associated medical precinct has attracted a large cluster of specialists, surgeons and allied health practitioners. For businesses in Norwest the commercial environment is modern and growing. Its a suburb where the businesses tend to be more established and professional which means the SEO competition is focused on specific services rather than broad local searches.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a specialist orthopaedic practice in the medical precinct in mid 2022 that had two surgeons specialising in knee and shoulder surgery. They were getting most of their patients through GP referrals and hospital connections which is where most of their surgical consultations had always come from. Their website had basic surgeon profiles and a contact page but no content around specific conditions or procedures. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and procedure pages for knee replacement, ACL reconstruction, shoulder reconstruction and arthroscopy, created patient information content, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from orthopaedic associations and medical directories. Over about eight months their self referred consultation requests went from about two per month to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the surgical content which a lot of other agencies in the Hills District outsource to writers who don't understand the clinical context.</p>

<p>The commercial office market in Norwest continues to grow and the supporting businesses like cafes, restaurants and service providers that cater to the office population are expanding. A hospitality business in Norwest that invests in local SEO can capture the lunch and meeting searches from the substantial working population in the business park.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Norwest businesses start from $1,200 per month. For medical specialists and surgical practices in Norwest its usually between $2,000 and $3,000 depending on how many conditions, procedures and surgeons are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Norwest business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Norwest area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
