<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a planned business and residential precinct within the 2153 postcode in the Hills District. The Business Park is one of the largest suburban commercial parks in Sydney, with corporate offices, technology companies, medical practices, and professional services firms. Marketown provides retail and dining options for the business park population. The Private Hospital and the surrounding medical precinct generate a concentration of specialist and allied health services. The Sydney Metro Northwest line serves the area via the local station, connecting to the CBD via Chatswood and the T1 line.</p>

<p>The business park model of the area creates a distinctive search landscape. Many businesses in the precinct target a broader Sydney catchment rather than just local residential demand. Technology companies, corporate services, and B2B providers use the area as an operational base while serving clients across Greater Sydney. For these businesses, SEO strategy extends beyond local targeting to include industry-specific and service-specific keywords. Health and medical practices near the hospital target both the local Hills District residential population and referred patients from a wider geographic area. Local SEO for local businesses needs to address both the immediate geographic market and the broader service catchment.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services and medical practices in competitive B2B or health categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
