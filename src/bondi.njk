<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Bondi and across the eastern beaches. We've been working with businesses around Campbell Parade, Hall Street, Curlewis Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Bondi has always been one of the most recognisable suburb brands in Sydney which creates both opportunities and challenges for local businesses.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Bondi has a massive tourism component that makes it different from almost every other suburb in Sydney. Theres a mix of surf schools, cafes, restaurants, fitness studios, wellness practitioners, backpacker services and retail all competing for both local and tourist search traffic. For businesses in Bondi the challenge is that search results are split between people looking for local services and people looking for tourist activities. Its a suburb where you need to be clear about who you're targeting because the search intent varies enormously depending on the time of year.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a pilates studio near Hall Street in early 2022 that had been running for about five years. Two instructors and a reception area with six reformers. They had a decent local following but were losing clients to newer studios opening up around Bondi which is where most of their member churn was coming from. Their website was a Mindbody booking page with no real content and their Google Business Profile was set up under the wrong category. We rebuilt the site with class descriptions, instructor profiles and location content, sorted out the GBP and built links from fitness directories and wellness blogs. Over about six months their new member sign ups from organic search went from about two per week to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the fitness content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The cafe and brunch scene in Bondi is probably the most competitive in Sydneys eastern suburbs. Theres dozens of cafes along Campbell Parade and the surrounding streets all fighting for the same morning crowd. Most of them rely on Instagram and word of mouth. A cafe in Bondi that properly manages its GBP and ranks for brunch and breakfast searches can pick up a significant amount of walk in traffic from both locals and tourists who search on their phone before deciding where to eat.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Bondi businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For fitness studios and wellness businesses in Bondi its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many services and locations are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Bondi clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Bondi strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Bondi area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
