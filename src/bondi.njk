  <div class="bondi-wrap">
    <h2>Why SEO Matters Here</h2>
    <p>The eastern suburbs are one of the tighter local markets in Sydney. Cafes along Campbell Parade, physio clinics on Hall Street, professional services wedged between retail strips. Everyone is chasing the same local customers, and most of the search traffic goes to the top three or four results.</p>
    <p>The area pulls in both residents and visitors, which means people search in different ways. Some type a specific suburb name. Others use "near me" or "eastern suburbs." A few just describe what they need and let Google figure out the rest.</p>
    <p>If your site is not structured to match those searches, you are invisible to people who are already looking for what you sell. That is the gap SEO closes.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="bondi-sec bondi-sec-alt" id="services">
  <div class="bondi-wrap">
    <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
    <p>Here is a straight breakdown of the SEO work I handle for eastern suburbs businesses:</p>
    <div class="bondi-sg">
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">01</span>
        <h3>Local SEO</h3>
        <p>Google Business Profile setup and optimisation, local citations, review strategy, and geo-targeted content. The aim is simple: when someone nearby searches for your service, your business shows up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">02</span>
        <h3>On-Page SEO</h3>
        <p>Title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, internal links, image alt text. I also do keyword mapping so each page targets a specific search intent instead of competing with your own pages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">03</span>
        <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
        <p>Crawlability, indexation issues, Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), mobile usability, structured data, robots.txt and sitemap checks. The unglamorous work that makes everything else stick.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">04</span>
        <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
        <p>Finding the terms people in your area actually type. I map those to pages, identify gaps your competitors have covered that you haven't, and build from there.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">05</span>
        <h3>Link Building</h3>
        <p>Manual outreach for relevant, high-quality Australian backlinks. No private blog networks. No paid link schemes. Slow and steady, because that is what holds up long term.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-sc">
        <span class="bondi-num">06</span>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>Blog posts, service pages, topic clusters. Written clearly enough that a real person wants to read it, structured well enough that search engines understand it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>I also handle <strong>ecommerce SEO</strong>, <strong>lead generation</strong> and <strong>web design</strong>. If you need <strong>Google Ads</strong> alongside organic work, I can fold that in too.</p>

  <div class="bondi-wrap">
  <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>A few things that tend to matter to business owners once they have been through the agency merry-go-round:</p>
    <div class="bondi-wu">
      <div class="bondi-wc">
        <span class="bondi-icon">📊</span>
        <h3>Research, Not Hunches</h3>
        <p>I apply findings from peer-reviewed optimisation research (including the E-GEO study from MIT and Columbia, 2025). Decisions are based on data and published evidence, not gut feelings or whatever worked for someone else's client last year.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-wc">
        <span class="bondi-icon">🎯</span>
        <h3>Honest Reporting</h3>
        <p>Monthly reports that track rankings, organic traffic, conversions and revenue impact. I explain what happened, what moved, and what I am doing next. No filler metrics to pad the report.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bondi-wc">
        <span class="bondi-icon">🤝</span>
        <h3>Month-to-Month</h3>
        <p>Rolling monthly agreements. If the work is not producing value, you stop. I would rather keep clients because the results justify it than because they signed a 12-month contract.</p>
      </div>

  <h2>Case Study</h2>
    <div class="bondi-cs">
      <h3>Physiotherapy Clinic, Eastern Suburbs</h3>
      <p>A physio clinic in the eastern suburbs came to me ranking on page 3 for their main keywords. The previous agency had created thin location pages and published generic content that did not match what patients actually search for.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong> Full technical audit and site speed fixes. Rebuilt service pages around verified patient search intent. Cleaned up and optimised their Google Business Profile with accurate categories, proper service descriptions and a review strategy. Built local citations and earned backlinks from relevant Australian health directories. Added LocalBusiness and MedicalBusiness structured data.</p>

      <div class="bondi-faq-q">How long before I see results from SEO?</div>
      <div class="bondi-faq-a">Most local businesses see ranking improvements within 8 to 16 weeks. In competitive eastern suburbs niches, it can take 4 to 6 months for positions to hold. I report monthly on rankings, traffic and conversions so progress is always visible.</div>

    <div class="bondi-faq-item">
      <div class="bondi-faq-q">What does SEO cost for a local business?</div>
      <div class="bondi-faq-a">It depends on your competition, the current state of your site and what you are trying to achieve. I quote after a free audit so you understand the scope before committing. No hidden fees, no lock-in.</div>

      <div class="bondi-faq-q">Do you optimise for AI search like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews?</div>
      <div class="bondi-faq-a">Yes. I structure content using generative engine optimisation (GEO) principles from peer-reviewed research (MIT and Columbia, 2025).

    <div class="bondi-faq-item">
      <div class="bondi-faq-q">What is different about how you work?</div>
