<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in search engine optimisation for businesses in Bondi and along the Campbell Parade and Hall Street areas. Bondi is one of the most searched suburbs in Sydney and the competition for visibility in Google is significant across almost every business category here.</p>

<p>The local business scene is driven by the beach. Cafes, surf shops, fitness studios, yoga studios, wellness clinics, real estate agents and a huge number of restaurants. Theres also a growing number of professional services firms catering to the affluent local population. The challenge in Bondi is that everyone wants to be visible here because the suburb gets searched so heavily by both locals and tourists.</p>

<p>We started working with a real estate agent on Campbell Parade in mid 2021. They'd been operating in Bondi for about twelve years but their online presence hadn't kept pace with the newer agencies that had set up around them. Their website was outdated, the Google Business Profile had limited information and they weren't ranking for any property related searches in the area. We rebuilt the website with suburb profile pages, property management content and seller focused landing pages. We fixed the GBP, built links from property directories and local business associations. After about ten months they were ranking on the first page for several key real estate terms in the eastern suburbs and their vendor appraisal requests from organic search went from almost zero to about eight per month.</p>

<p>For the fitness and wellness businesses around Bondi the market is extremely crowded. There are probably more personal trainers, yoga studios and Pilates studios per square kilometre here than anywhere else in Australia. The businesses that invest in even basic SEO tend to stand out because most of them rely entirely on Instagram and word of mouth.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees, no contracts. Month to month with 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All work done by our Sydney team. We don't send anything offshore.</p>
