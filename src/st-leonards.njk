<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in St Leonards and the surrounding areas of Greenwich, Wollstonecraft and Naremburn. St Leonards is one of Sydney's major medical and commercial precincts. The area around the Royal North Shore Hospital, the Mater Hospital and the Pacific Highway medical suites has one of the highest concentrations of medical specialists in New South Wales.</p>

<p>The specialist medical market here is intensely competitive. Theres probably more than a hundred medical specialists operating within a few blocks of St Leonards station — orthopaedic surgeons, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, oncologists, dermatologists. Most of them rely on GP referrals and don't think about search visibility. But the ones that do invest in SEO are receiving a steady flow of patient enquiries from people researching specialists before asking their GP for a specific referral. That dynamic is becoming more common and its changing how specialist practices think about their online presence.</p>

<p>We started working with a specialist medical practice near the hospital in 2021. They had three specialists and a practice manager who handled everything including their online presence. The website was outdated, the GBP had basic information and they had no visibility in search for any of their specialty terms. We rebuilt the website around individual condition and procedure pages, optimised the GBP with correct speciality categories and attributes, fixed inconsistencies across medical directories and built links from medical associations and hospital affiliated directories. Over about nine months they went from having no organic visibility to appearing in search results for their key procedure terms across the north shore. The practice manager told us they were receiving about eight to ten new patient enquiries per month directly from search which was entirely new for them.</p>

<p>Outside the medical sector St Leonards also has a significant number of technology companies and professional services firms in the commercial towers. These businesses typically need national SEO strategies rather than local.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Specialist medical and competitive industries from $1,800. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts.</p>
