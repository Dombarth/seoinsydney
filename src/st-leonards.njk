<h2>The Search Landscape in St Leonards</h2>

<p>St Leonards sits between North Sydney and Chatswood on the Pacific Highway. The suburb's commercial activity is dominated by the medical precinct surrounding Royal North Shore Hospital and the corporate office towers along the Pacific Highway. This creates a distinctive search landscape with strong demand for both health and professional services.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in St Leonards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High concentration of specialist medical and surgical practices</li>
    <li>Allied health practitioners including physiotherapy, radiology and pathology</li>
    <li>Corporate and technology businesses in the office market</li>
    <li>Patient searches for specific conditions, procedures and specialists</li>
    <li>Strong competition from established medical practices with mature websites</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in St Leonards</h2>

<p>We worked with an orthopaedic surgery practice near Royal North Shore Hospital that had two surgeons and had been operating for about five years. Their referral pipeline was healthy but they wanted to build direct patient awareness. Their website listed their procedures on a single page with minimal detail. Over about seven months we rebuilt the site with individual procedure pages, created content around common conditions and recovery questions, optimised the Google Business Profile with correct specialist categories and built links from medical directories and health publications. The practice started ranking for condition-specific searches and receiving direct enquiries from patients who found them through search.</p>

<p>For corporate businesses in the St Leonards office market, the approach depends on the target audience. Businesses serving local or Sydney-based clients benefit from local SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation. Those targeting national clients need broader organic search strategies focused on industry terms and content authority.</p>
