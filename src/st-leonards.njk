<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a lower North Shore suburb within the 2065 postcode, positioned between North Sydney and Chatswood. The suburb is defined by two key anchors: the Royal North Shore Hospital and its associated health precinct, and the Pacific Highway commercial corridor. The hospital precinct generates a concentration of specialist medical practices, allied health services, pathology laboratories, and medical imaging centres. The local station on the T1 North Shore Line and the new Crows Nest Metro Station nearby provide strong public transport connectivity. The suburb has undergone significant residential development in recent years, with multiple high-rise apartment buildings along the Pacific Highway.</p>

<p>The health precinct creates a specialised search landscape here. Medical practitioners, dental specialists, physiotherapists, and allied health professionals compete for patient referral searches and location-based health queries. Competition in medical categories is higher than average for a suburban location, driven by the density of practices clustered around the hospital. For professional services, technology companies, and commercial businesses along the Pacific Highway, competition is moderate, and the suburb benefits from strong transport accessibility that draws workers and visitors from across the North Shore.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For medical practices and specialist health services near the hospital precinct, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
