<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in St Leonards and across the lower north shore. We've been working with businesses around the Pacific Highway, Atchison Street, Chandos Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and St Leonards has changed dramatically with the residential tower development and the growth of the medical precinct around Royal North Shore Hospital.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>St Leonards has two distinct commercial identities. Theres the corporate and technology sector in the office towers along the Pacific Highway and theres the medical and allied health precinct clustered around Royal North Shore Hospital. For businesses in St Leonards this creates a dual search environment where some businesses are competing nationally and others are competing very locally. Its a suburb where medical practices in particular can benefit from SEO because the density of health providers means patients are actively searching and comparing options.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a physiotherapy and sports medicine clinic near Atchison Street in late 2020 that had been operating for about eight years. Four physiotherapists, an exercise physiologist and a massage therapist. They had a solid referral network with local GPs but their organic visibility was almost zero which is where most of their untapped growth potential was. Their website was a WordPress template with generic service descriptions and their Google Business Profile had incomplete service listings. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and treatment pages, created content around sports injuries and rehabilitation topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from sports medicine directories and physiotherapy associations. Over about eight months their self referred patients went from about five per week to around fourteen. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the physiotherapy content which a lot of other agencies in St Leonards outsource.</p>

<p>The growing residential population in St Leonards is creating more demand for local services like cafes, restaurants, retail and everyday health services. Businesses that have been primarily serving the office worker crowd now have an evening and weekend customer base emerging and those new residents are searching online for everything nearby.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for St Leonards businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical and allied health practices in St Leonards its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many services, conditions and practitioners are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your St Leonards business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the St Leonards area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
