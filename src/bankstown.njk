<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Bankstown and across the Canterbury Bankstown area. We've been working with businesses around Bankstown City Plaza, Restwell Street, Chapel Road, The Mall and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Bankstown has been evolving with the metro line extension and the CBD redevelopment changing the commercial landscape.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Bankstown is a major commercial centre serving a large and diverse population across the Canterbury Bankstown LGA. Theres a strong concentration of legal firms, migration agents, accounting practices, medical services, real estate agencies and a massive retail and dining precinct. For businesses in Bankstown the search volume is high across virtually every service category because the population is large and the suburb functions as the regional hub. Its a market where the businesses that invest in SEO consistently outperform those relying on traditional methods because the online competition is still surprisingly weak given the size of the market.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a tax and accounting practice near Chapel Road in early 2022 that had been operating for about five years. Two accountants serving small businesses, sole traders and individual tax returns. They were getting most of their clients from community referrals which is where most of their work had always come from. Their website was a Facebook page only and they didn't have a proper website or Google Business Profile. We built a site from scratch with individual service pages, created content around tax deadlines, deduction guides and small business accounting topics, set up and optimised the GBP and built links from accounting directories. Over about seven months their organic enquiries went from zero to about eight per month. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the financial content which a lot of other agencies in the Bankstown area outsource.</p>

<p>The restaurant and dining market in Bankstown is massive and diverse. Theres cuisines from every part of the world concentrated within a few blocks. Most restaurants rely on word of mouth and community networks. A restaurant in Bankstown that invests in local SEO and GBP management can attract customers from across Sydney who are searching for specific cuisines because Bankstown has become a known food destination.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Bankstown businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For accounting firms and professional services in Bankstown its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Bankstown business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Bankstown area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
