<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in search engine optimisation for businesses in Glebe and along Glebe Point Road. Glebe has always had a bit of a village feel to it despite being so close to the city. The strip along Glebe Point Road from Broadway down towards the water is one of the more eclectic business streets in the inner west with bookshops, cafes, vintage stores, op shops and a mix of restaurants.</p>

<p>The proximity to Sydney University means there's a significant student population and a lot of the businesses here cater to that market. Budget eateries, second hand bookshops, share house supplies. But theres also a growing number of professional services and wellness businesses that have set up in Glebe because the rents are more reasonable than Surry Hills or Newtown and you're still within walking distance of the CBD.</p>

<p>We took on a wellness clinic on Glebe Point Road in 2023 that offered naturopathy, acupuncture and massage. They'd been open for about three years and had built a small client base through referrals but weren't getting any enquiries from Google. Their website was a WordPress site with a home page and a contact page. No individual service pages, no practitioner profiles and the Google Business Profile was set up under the wrong category. We built out service pages for each modality, created practitioner profiles, fixed the GBP categories and built links from health directories and local business listings. Within about five months they were consistently showing up in map results for wellness and naturopath searches in the area.</p>

<p>The Glebe Markets on Saturdays also bring visitor traffic and there are opportunities for businesses to capture searches from people planning their visit. "Markets Glebe" and "things to do Glebe" are searches that local businesses can benefit from even if they're not directly related to the markets.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. No setup fees, no lock in contracts, month to month.</p>

<p>All work done in house by our Sydney team. No offshore outsourcing.</p>
