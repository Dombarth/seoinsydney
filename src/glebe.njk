We have been working with businesses along Glebe Point Road, Broadway and the surrounding streets since 2016.

<h2>The Search Landscape in Glebe</h2>

<p>Glebe's commercial activity runs primarily along Glebe Point Road, stretching from Broadway toward the waterfront. The suburb is home to a mix of cafes, restaurants, bookshops, vintage stores, health practitioners and professional services firms. Its proximity to Sydney University creates additional search demand from students, staff and visitors.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Glebe:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High hospitality density along Glebe Point Road</li>
    <li>University-adjacent businesses with student and staff search patterns</li>
    <li>Independent retail including bookshops, vintage stores and specialty shops</li>

<h2>How We Work in Glebe</h2>

<p>We worked with a bookshop on Glebe Point Road that had been trading for about twenty years. They had a strong local reputation but almost no online visibility beyond social media. Their website was a basic page with opening hours and an address. Over about four months we rebuilt the site with pages for their key categories, started a modest content programme around book-related searches, optimised their Google Business Profile and built citations across relevant directories. They started appearing in local search results and receiving online enquiries for the first time.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses along Glebe Point Road, the challenge is similar to other inner-city dining strips. There are many venues competing for a limited number of map pack positions. Google Business Profile optimisation is the most immediate lever. Review volume, photo quality, response to reviews and regular activity all signal relevance to Google.</p>
