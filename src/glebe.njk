  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues on the area Point Road or health practices in competitive categories, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2037 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches, though hospitality and retail categories along the area Point Road are more competitive. Businesses with established Google Business Profiles typically see faster initial improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner west including Newtown, Annandale, Ultimo, Forest Lodge, Camperdown, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner west suburb within the 2037 postcode, located between the CBD and the University of Sydney. The area Point Road is the primary commercial strip, running the length of the suburb from Broadway to the area Point itself, where it meets the foreshore of Blackwattle Bay. The street carries a dense mix of cafes, restaurants, bookshops, vintage stores, and independent retail that reflects the suburb's academic and creative character. The local markets at the area Public School operate every Saturday and draw visitors from across Sydney.</p>

<p>The suburb's proximity to the University of Sydney, UTS, and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital creates a large surrounding population of students, academic staff, and health professionals. This generates consistent search demand for hospitality, accommodation, health services, and specialist retail. Businesses on the area Point Road compete for visibility in a suburb where foot traffic and local search discovery overlap significantly. A well-structured local SEO campaign captures enquiries from residents, students, and visitors searching for services in the area.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive hospitality or health categories along the area Point Road, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
