<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Glebe and across the inner west fringe. We've been working with businesses along Glebe Point Road, Broadway, St Johns Road and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Glebe has always had a strong independent business culture that makes it different from more commercial suburbs nearby.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Glebe has a distinct mix of bookshops, cafes, restaurants, vintage stores, wellness practitioners and small professional services firms along Glebe Point Road. Theres also a strong student and academic presence because of the proximity to Sydney University and UTS. For businesses in Glebe the customer base splits between long term residents, students and visitors coming for the markets or the dining strip. Its a suburb where local SEO works well because people search with very specific intent when looking for businesses in Glebe rather than generic Sydney wide searches.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a naturopath near the bottom end of Glebe Point Road in early 2021 who had been practising for about nine years. Solo practitioner with a consulting room in a shared wellness space. She was getting most of her clients from referrals and a couple of practitioner directories which is where most of her bookings had always come from. Her website was a Squarespace template with an about page and a contact form. We built out individual service and condition pages, sorted out the Google Business Profile with proper health categories, created content around the specific conditions she treated and built links from naturopathy associations and health directories. Over about seven months her self referred client bookings went from about two a week to around six. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the health content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't write properly.</p>

<p>The Glebe Markets on Saturdays bring a lot of foot traffic but the businesses along Glebe Point Road need to attract customers throughout the week. A Glebe business that invests in local SEO can build consistent weekday visibility rather than relying on weekend crowds. The dining scene is competitive but most restaurants in Glebe still rely on social media and UberEats rather than organic search.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Glebe businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For health practitioners and hospitality businesses in Glebe its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Glebe business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Glebe area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
