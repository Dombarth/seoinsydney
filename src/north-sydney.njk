suburbContext: |
    <p>North Sydney is a major commercial centre located directly across the Harbour Bridge from the CBD. The area houses corporate headquarters, professional service firms, and technology companies.</p>
    <p>The business profile is predominantly B2B-focused, including advertising agencies, legal firms, accounting practices, IT services, and financial services. Retail and hospitality primarily serve the weekday worker population.</p>
    <p>Businesses in the area often target clients across the metropolitan region and nationally, making SEO strategy broader than purely local search optimisation.</p>
competitionSection: |
    <p>The concentration of professional services creates significant SEO competition in these sectors. Many firms have established online presence and ongoing SEO investments.</p>
    <p>Competition varies considerably by industry. Technology and professional services face intense competition, while niche B2B services may have less crowded search landscapes.</p>
    <p>The corporate nature of most businesses in the area means B2B keywords and longer sales cycle considerations often influence SEO strategy more than immediate local search.</p>
