<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in North Sydney across the areas of recruitment, technology, financial services and professional services. North Sydney is one of the densest commercial centres in Australia. The towers along Miller Street, Berry Street, Walker Street and the Pacific Highway house hundreds of businesses that rely on search visibility to generate leads and attract talent.</p>

<p>The recruitment industry in North Sydney is particularly concentrated. Theres probably 50 or more recruitment agencies operating from the area and most of them are competing for the same search terms. The ones that have invested in SEO for more than 12 months typically have a significant advantage because recruitment is one of those industries where organic rankings compound over time.</p>

<p>We started working with a recruitment agency on Miller Street in 2020. They specialised in IT and technology recruitment and had about 15 consultants. Their website was decent but hadn't been optimised for search. They were relying on job boards, LinkedIn and referrals for both candidates and clients. We built out a content strategy around their key specialisations — software development, cybersecurity, data and analytics, cloud engineering — with individual pages targeting both employer and candidate search intent. We also optimised the GBP, cleaned up directory listings and built links from industry publications and associations. Over about ten months they went from having almost no organic visibility to ranking for several high value recruitment terms across Sydney. Their inbound client enquiries from organic search went from zero to about six per month and candidate applications through the website roughly tripled.</p>

<p>For the technology and SaaS businesses in North Sydney the competition is national and sometimes international. These businesses typically need broader SEO strategies that go beyond local search. We handle both local and national campaigns.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. National and ecommerce campaigns from $2,000. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
