<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in North Sydney and across the lower north shore. We've been working with businesses around Miller Street, Berry Street, Walker Street, Mount Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and North Sydney has shifted a lot in recent years with the metro station, the removal of the freeway on ramp and the new development around the CBD.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>North Sydney is a major commercial centre with a heavy concentration of corporate offices, technology companies, advertising agencies, financial services firms and professional services practices. For businesses in North Sydney the SEO competition is strong because you're up against companies with significant marketing budgets and established online presences. Its a market where smaller firms need a focused strategy rather than trying to compete on broad terms. The businesses in North Sydney that do well with SEO are the ones targeting specific services and niche terms rather than generic industry searches.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an accounting firm near Miller Street in mid 2021 that had four partners and about twelve staff. They had been operating in North Sydney for about fifteen years but their website was still the same template from 2012 and they weren't ranking for any accounting related searches which is where most of their missed opportunities were. Their Google Business Profile hadn't been touched since it was verified. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages for tax, advisory, audit and SMSF, created content around the specific accounting questions their prospective clients were searching and built links from accounting directories and industry publications. Over about ten months their organic enquiries went from about two per month to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the financial content which a lot of other agencies in North Sydney outsource overseas.</p>

<p>The lunch and dining market in North Sydney has been growing with the new metro bringing more foot traffic to the area. Restaurants and cafes that rely on the office worker population can benefit from local SEO by ranking for lunch and nearby dining searches. Most of the food businesses in North Sydney still rely on walk by traffic rather than online visibility.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for North Sydney businesses start from $1,200 per month. For corporate and professional services firms in North Sydney its usually between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many services and industries are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our North Sydney clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every North Sydney strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the North Sydney area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
