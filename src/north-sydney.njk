  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services, tech companies, and financial firms in the local CBD, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2060 postcode has above-average competition for professional service categories due to the concentration of corporate offices. Businesses with established websites and content histories can see faster improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the lower North Shore including Crows Nest, St Leonards, Neutral Bay, Milsons Point, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is the lower North Shore's commercial centre within the 2060 postcode, functioning as Sydney's secondary CBD. The suburb has a concentration of corporate offices, technology companies, financial services firms, and professional service providers across multiple commercial towers along Miller Street, Berry Street, and the Pacific Highway. The local station on the T1 North Shore Line and the Victoria Cross Metro Station on the new Sydney Metro provide direct transport links to the CBD and beyond. The suburb also has a residential component, particularly around McMahons Point and Lavender Bay on the harbour foreshore.</p>

<p>The density of professional service firms here creates above-average search competition for business-to-business and professional service queries. Technology companies, accounting firms, legal practices, recruitment agencies, and marketing businesses all compete for visibility in search results. For these businesses, organic search visibility reduces dependency on paid acquisition channels and builds a sustainable source of enquiries. Hospitality businesses along Miller Street and in the surrounding retail precinct compete for a different search profile, targeting the large daytime working population and nearby residents.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services and technology companies in competitive B2B categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
