        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How Patients Find Dentists Online</h2>
            <p>When someone needs a dentist, they usually search Google. The search might be "dentist near me", "dentist [suburb name]", or something specific like "emergency dentist Sydney" or "Invisalign cost".</p>
            
            <p>The practices that appear in those searches get the calls. The ones that don't appear, don't. It's that simple.</p>
            
            <p>Dental SEO is about making sure your practice appears when potential patients in your area search for the services you offer. Not just for "dentist" but for all the treatments and questions that lead to appointments.</p>

<!-- What Dental SEO Includes Section -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Dental SEO Includes</h2>
            
            <h3>Google Business Profile Optimisation</h3>
            <p>Your Google Business Profile is what appears in Maps and local search results. For dental practices, this is often the most important source of new patients. I optimise your profile, help you get more reviews, and post regular updates to keep it active.</p>
            
            <h3>Service Pages for Treatments</h3>
            <p>Patients search for specific treatments: teeth whitening, dental implants, Invisalign, veneers, crowns. Each treatment deserves its own page explaining what it is, who it's for, and what to expect. These pages capture patients researching specific procedures.</p>
            
            <h3>Location Pages</h3>
            <p>If your practice is in Parramatta, you want to appear when someone searches "dentist Parramatta". Location pages target suburb-specific searches and help patients in your area find you.</p>
            
            <h3>Content That Answers Patient Questions</h3>
            <p>Patients research before booking. "How much does Invisalign cost?", "Does teeth whitening damage enamel?", "When should children first see a dentist?" Content answering these questions captures research-stage searches and builds trust before the first appointment.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
            <p>Site speed, mobile usability, and technical issues affect whether your site ranks. I fix technical problems that might be holding back your visibility.</p>
            
            <h3>Review Management</h3>
            <p>Reviews affect both your local ranking and whether patients choose you. I help you get more reviews and respond professionally to all of them.</p>

<!-- Competition Section -->
<section class="content-section">

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Dental SEO Competition in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney has a lot of dental practices. The CBD, North Sydney, Parramatta, and other major centres have high competition. Smaller suburbs may be less competitive but still require proper optimisation to rank well.</p>
            
            <p>What this means for your practice:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Established practices</strong> with good online presence have a head start. New practices need more work to catch up.</li>
                <li><strong>Location matters.</strong> A dentist in Chatswood competes with other Chatswood dentists, not CBD practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialist services</strong> like implants or orthodontics have different competition than general dentistry.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate chains</strong> often have dedicated marketing teams. Independent practices need smart SEO to compete.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I research your specific competitive landscape and build a strategy around what will actually work for your practice.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Dental SEO Pricing</h2>
            <p>SEO for single-location dental practices starts from $1,200 per month. This includes Google Business Profile management, content creation, technical optimisation, and monthly reporting.</p>
            
            <p>Multi-location practices or those in highly competitive areas may need larger campaigns. I assess your specific situation and provide a fixed quote before starting.</p>
            
            <p>No lock-in contracts. Month-to-month with 30 days notice. You stay because you're seeing results, not because you're locked in.</p>
