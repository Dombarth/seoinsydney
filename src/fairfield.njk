<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Fairfield and the surrounding suburbs of Cabramatta, Canley Heights, Fairfield Heights and Villawood. Fairfield is one of the most culturally diverse areas in Australia. The commercial areas along the Horsley Drive, Smart Street, Ware Street and the streets around Fairfield Forum support a massive number of businesses catering to the local Vietnamese, Assyrian, Arabic, Chinese and other communities.</p>

<p>The food and hospitality market in the Fairfield and Cabramatta area is internationally recognised. Cabramatta in particular is one of Sydney's most popular food destinations. Restaurants and food businesses here attract customers from across Sydney and interstate. The search behaviour for these businesses extends well beyond the local area — people search for Vietnamese food in Sydney, Cabramatta restaurants and specific dishes from their homes in the eastern suburbs, north shore and beyond.</p>

<p>We worked with a Vietnamese restaurant in Cabramatta that had been operating for about fifteen years. They were a local institution with a loyal customer base but their online presence hadn't kept up with younger competitors. The website was an old static page and the GBP had minimal information. We rebuilt the website with proper menu content, professional food photography pages and information about the restaurant's history and specialties. We optimised the GBP and pushed for reviews from their regular customers. Within about four months they were showing prominently in search results for Vietnamese food searches across southwestern Sydney and for broader Sydney searches. The owner said they started seeing more younger diners and groups who had clearly found them through Google, and their weekend queues got noticeably longer.</p>

<p>For the professional services businesses in Fairfield — tax agents, migration agents, lawyers — serving the multicultural population requires understanding specific search behaviours. We tailor SEO strategies accordingly.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
