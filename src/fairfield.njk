<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Fairfield and across the Fairfield LGA. We've been working with businesses around The Crescent, Smart Street, Ware Street, Spencer Street and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Fairfield has maintained its role as a key commercial centre for one of the most diverse communities in Sydney.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Fairfield is the commercial hub of the Fairfield local government area with a large and multicultural population. Theres a strong concentration of migration agents, legal firms, medical practices, accounting services, trade businesses and a diverse hospitality scene. For businesses in Fairfield the search behaviour is heavily influenced by the multicultural community and many searches are service specific rather than generic. Its a market where businesses that invest in targeted local SEO can build strong positions because the online competition is still relatively weak compared to the actual demand for services in the area.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a family law practice near The Crescent in mid 2022 that had been operating for about four years. Two solicitors handling family law, AVOs and property settlements. They were getting most of their clients from legal aid referrals and community organisations which is where most of their matters had always come from. Their website was a basic one page site and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. We rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around family law processes and common legal questions, sorted out the GBP with proper categories and built links from legal directories. Over about seven months their private client enquiries from organic search went from about one per month to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the legal content which a lot of other agencies in the Fairfield area outsource.</p>

<p>The restaurant scene in Fairfield is diverse and increasingly recognised across Sydney. Theres Vietnamese, Assyrian, Lebanese, Cambodian and other cuisines that draw food lovers from across the city. A restaurant in Fairfield that invests in local SEO can attract customers from well beyond the local area because people search specifically for Fairfield dining as a destination.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Fairfield businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For legal firms and migration agencies in Fairfield its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many practice areas or visa categories are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Fairfield business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Fairfield area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
