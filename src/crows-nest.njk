<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Crows Nest across hospitality, health and wellness, retail and professional services. Crows Nest has one of the best village atmospheres on the north shore. Willoughby Road and Alexander Street are packed with restaurants, cafes, boutiques and health practitioners all serving a local population that values quality and convenience.</p>

<p>The health and wellness sector in Crows Nest is particularly strong. Theres a high concentration of physiotherapists, chiropractors, dentists, psychologists and allied health practitioners along Willoughby Road and the surrounding streets. The new Crows Nest metro station is bringing more foot traffic and more people searching for services in the area which is increasing competition for local search terms.</p>

<p>We worked with a physiotherapy practice on Willoughby Road that had been operating for about eight years. They had four practitioners and a loyal patient base but were getting almost all their new patients from GP referrals and word of mouth. Their website was a basic WordPress site with minimal content and their GBP hadn't been updated in years. We rebuilt the website with individual treatment and condition pages, created content around the specific injuries and conditions their practitioners specialised in and optimised the GBP with proper categories photos and service descriptions. We built links from physiotherapy associations and local health directories. Within about seven months they were ranking for physiotherapy and related treatment searches across Crows Nest, St Leonards, North Sydney and Neutral Bay. Their self referred patients increased from about three per week to around ten.</p>

<p>The restaurant and cafe scene in Crows Nest is competitive but many businesses here still don't do any SEO. A restaurant that invests in basic local optimisation and GBP management can stand out relatively quickly because most competitors are relying purely on foot traffic and social media.</p>
