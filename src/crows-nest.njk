<h2>The Search Landscape in Crows Nest</h2>

<p>Crows Nest functions as the village centre of the lower North Shore, with commercial activity concentrated along Willoughby Road and Alexander Street. The area has a strong hospitality scene, a good density of health practitioners and a growing number of professional services firms. The new metro station has increased the area's accessibility and commercial appeal.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Crows Nest:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dense hospitality strip along Willoughby Road with strong dining search competition</li>
    <li>Health and dental practices serving the lower North Shore</li>
    <li>Professional services firms in office spaces above the retail strip</li>
    <li>Boutique retail competing with online and nearby Chatswood shopping centres</li>
    <li>Metro station increasing search demand from visitors and commuters</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Crows Nest</h2>

<p>We worked with a psychology practice on Willoughby Road that had two psychologists and was relying primarily on GP referrals. Their website was a basic page with their qualifications and a booking number. Over about five months we rebuilt the site with individual pages for each area of practice, optimised their Google Business Profile with correct psychology categories and service descriptions, and built citations across psychology and health directories. The practice started receiving direct enquiries from people in the area who were searching for specific therapeutic approaches rather than relying solely on referrals.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses along Willoughby Road, the competition for dining searches is strong but manageable. Google Business Profile optimisation is the most immediate lever. The businesses that maintain their GBP actively with regular photos, responses to reviews and correct category information tend to appear in the map pack more consistently.</p>
