<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Balmain and along the Darling Street strip. Balmain has a very particular local business scene. Its mostly small independent operators — pubs, cafes, boutique retail, restaurants, a few professional services firms operating out of converted terrace houses. The area has a strong local identity and the businesses that do well here tend to have deep roots in the community.</p>

<p>Darling Street is the main commercial artery running from the Balmain East end through to Rozelle. The businesses along here range from long established pubs like the London Hotel and the Riverview through to newer cafes, wine bars and boutique shops. A lot of these places have never done any SEO and rely entirely on the Balmain locals knowing they exist.</p>

<p>We started working with a renovation company based in Balmain in early 2023. They specialised in heritage terrace renovations which is a significant niche in the inner west. They had a basic website with a few project photos but no individual service pages, no location content and a Google Business Profile with almost no information. We built out proper service pages, added a project gallery with descriptions and location details, optimised the GBP and built links from home renovation directories and local trade publications. Within about seven months they were ranking on the first page for several inner west renovation related search terms and their enquiry rate had roughly doubled.</p>

<p>The hospitality businesses in Balmain compete mostly within the inner west market. People searching for "pub Balmain" or "restaurant Balmain" are usually locals or people who already know the area. The search volumes are smaller than somewhere like the CBD but the intent is very high. Getting into the top three map results for these searches can make a real difference for a small venue.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. No contracts, month to month, 30 days notice. Written quote before we start.</p>

<p>Everything done in house by our Sydney team.</p>
