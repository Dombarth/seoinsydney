<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation services for businesses operating in and around Barangaroo. The precinct along Hickson Road and around International Towers is relatively new compared to the rest of the CBD but its quickly become one of the most important commercial hubs in Sydney.</p>

<p>Barangaroo is primarily corporate. Financial services firms, management consultancies, legal practices and corporate hospitality venues make up the bulk of the businesses here. The restaurants and bars along the waterfront are also significant, competing for both the corporate lunch crowd and the weekend visitor market.</p>

<p>We started working with a financial advisory firm that relocated to Barangaroo in early 2023. They had a website that was built about five years earlier, no blog, no individual service pages and their Google Business Profile still had their old Kent Street address. Their organic traffic was almost entirely branded searches meaning people who already knew their name. We updated the website with proper service pages for each area they cover, fixed the GBP, built links from relevant financial publications and industry directories. After about nine months they were ranking on the first page for several non branded financial planning terms in Sydney.</p>

<p>The hospitality businesses in Barangaroo face a different type of competition. They're competing against established restaurants across the CBD, The Rocks and Darling Harbour for dining related searches. The area is still building its identity in search and businesses that invest in SEO now are likely to establish strong positions before the competition catches up.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Corporate and financial services SEO is typically higher depending on competition. Written quote before we start. No setup fees.</p>

<p>No lock in contracts. Month to month with 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you leave.</p>
