faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms, financial companies, or hospitality venues in the precinct, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $3,000 depending on competition level and the scope of target keywords. Written quote with a full breakdown provided before work begins."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO here?"
    a: "the area sits within the broader Sydney CBD search landscape, which is the most competitive in Australia. However, the area-specific searches have lower competition than general CBD terms. Businesses that optimise for the area precinct specifically can establish visibility faster than those targeting broad CBD keywords."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Sydney including the CBD, Pyrmont, Darling Harbour, North Sydney, and all suburbs in the metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape and industry of each business."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a purpose-built commercial and residential precinct on the western waterfront of the Sydney CBD, within the 2000 postcode. The precinct is divided into three areas: the area South, which houses the International Towers office complex and the Crown Sydney hotel; the area Central, which is under ongoing development; and the area Reserve headland park to the north. The precinct connects to Wynyard and the CBD to the east, Darling Harbour to the south, and is serviced by the area ferry wharf and the new Sydney Metro station.</p>

<p>Search competition specific to the area is emerging rather than established. The precinct is relatively new compared to other CBD areas, which means businesses that invest in search engine optimisation now can establish strong organic positions before competition intensifies. For professional services firms, financial companies, and hospitality venues in the International Towers and Crown precinct, local search visibility provides a direct channel to the workers, residents, and visitors who search for services in the area.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>The commercial sector here is dominated by financial services, legal, and corporate advisory firms that have established offices in the International Towers complex. These businesses compete with established CBD firms for professional services search terms but can differentiate through the area-specific content and local optimisation that targets the growing search volume for the precinct.</p>

<p>The hospitality sector here has grown rapidly with the development of the Crown precinct, Watermans Cove dining area, and the restaurants and bars along the waterfront. For hospitality venues, Google Business Profile optimisation, review management, and visibility in dining and entertainment searches are the primary drivers of bookings and foot traffic. The precinct's role as a destination for both workers and visitors creates consistent search demand throughout the week.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services and financial firms targeting broader CBD and metropolitan searches, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $3,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
