<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Barangaroo and across the western harbour precinct. We've been working with businesses around International Towers, Barangaroo Avenue, Watermans Quay and the surrounding areas since about 2018 when the commercial towers started filling up and Barangaroo has grown rapidly since then with Crown Sydney and the residential towers adding a whole new layer to the precinct.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Barangaroo is heavily weighted towards corporate and professional services. Theres a large concentration of law firms, financial services companies, consulting firms, fintech startups and corporate advisory businesses particularly in International Towers and the surrounding commercial buildings. For businesses in Barangaroo the SEO competition tends to be at a national level rather than local because these firms are competing for clients across Sydney and Australia not just within the precinct. Its a different type of campaign to what we run for suburban businesses.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a financial advisory firm in International Towers in mid 2021 that had about eight advisors and a strong book of existing clients. They wanted to grow their self managed super fund and retirement planning divisions but their website was a generic corporate template with four pages and no real content which is where most of their online visibility problems came from. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages, created educational content around SMSF, retirement planning and wealth management topics and built links from financial planning associations and industry publications. Over about ten months their organic enquiries for SMSF related searches went from zero to about six per month. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the financial content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource to generic writers.</p>

<p>The hospitality scene in Barangaroo has matured quickly. Theres a strong lunch trade from the office population and the evening dining market has grown with the Crown precinct. Restaurants and bars in Barangaroo that invest in local SEO and GBP management can capture searches from the massive working population that is already there five days a week looking for lunch and after work options.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Barangaroo businesses start from $1,200 per month. For corporate and professional services firms in Barangaroo its usually between $2,000 and $3,000 depending on how competitive the industry is and how many services are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Barangaroo clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Barangaroo strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Barangaroo area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
