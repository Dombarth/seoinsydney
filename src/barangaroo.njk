suburbContext: |
    <p>Barangaroo is a waterfront precinct on the western edge of the CBD, developed as a mixed-use commercial and residential area. The precinct houses major corporate headquarters, premium dining, and a growing residential community.</p>
    <p>The business profile includes major financial institutions, professional service firms, premium restaurants and bars, and a casino and entertainment complex. The area targets both corporate workers and visitors.</p>
    <p>As a relatively new precinct, many businesses are still establishing their online presence, creating opportunities for early SEO investment to build search visibility ahead of competitors.</p>
competitionSection: |
    <p>Corporate tenants in the area often compete nationally rather than locally, with SEO strategies targeting industry and service keywords rather than location-based terms.</p>
    <p>The premium hospitality sector faces competition from established dining precincts across the city. New venues must build review profiles and search visibility from scratch.</p>
    <p>The ongoing development of the precinct means the competitive landscape is still forming, with new businesses continuing to open as commercial and residential space becomes available.</p>
