<h2>The Search Landscape in Barangaroo</h2>

<p>Barangaroo is a relatively new precinct, and many of the businesses based here are large corporate operations or professional services firms. The search competition is shaped by the types of businesses in the area rather than the geographic density typical of other inner-city suburbs.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Barangaroo:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Financial services and consulting firms competing for high-value professional terms</li>
    <li>Legal firms targeting practice-area-specific searches across Sydney</li>
    <li>Technology companies with both local and national search requirements</li>
    <li>Hospitality venues in the waterfront dining precinct</li>
    <li>Many businesses competing more on industry terms than geographic terms</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Barangaroo</h2>

<p>We worked with a financial planning firm that relocated to International Towers in 2021. They had an established client base but their online presence consisted of a basic website with limited content and no organic search strategy. Their competitors in the financial planning space had been investing in content and SEO for several years. Over about nine months we rebuilt their content architecture with individual service pages for each planning area, developed a content strategy around the financial questions their target clients were searching for, and built links from financial publications and industry directories. The organic traffic growth was gradual but consistent, and they began receiving inbound enquiries from high-value prospects.</p>

<p>The hospitality sector in Barangaroo is concentrated around the waterfront and the Crown precinct. For restaurants and bars, Google Business Profile optimisation and local search visibility are the primary channels. The competition is less dense than in areas like Surry Hills or the CBD, which means local SEO work can produce results more quickly.</p>
