<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Coogee across hospitality, health and fitness, retail and professional services. Coogee has its own identity separate from Bondi. Its a residential beachside suburb with a loyal local population and a commercial strip along Coogee Bay Road and Arden Street that serves both locals and visitors.</p>

<p>The hospitality businesses along Coogee Bay Road and around the beach compete for a relatively small pool of search traffic compared to Bondi. But because fewer businesses here are actively doing SEO the competition is lower and results can come faster. Theres less noise to cut through.</p>

<p>We worked with a cafe on Coogee Bay Road that had been operating for about five years. They had a strong local following but were invisible in search. When people searched for breakfast or brunch in the eastern suburbs they weren't appearing. The owner had tried running the Google Business Profile himself but the categories were wrong, the hours were inconsistent with other listings and there were duplicate profiles from a previous location. We cleaned all that up, rebuilt the GBP from scratch, got reviews flowing properly and optimised the website for the key food and drink searches in the area. Within about five months they were showing in the map pack for most cafe and restaurant searches around Coogee. The owner said weekday mornings which used to be quiet started filling up with people he'd never seen before.</p>

<p>For the fitness and wellness businesses in Coogee theres a good opportunity because the suburb has a health conscious population but not as many competing providers as Bondi or Randwick. A Pilates studio, yoga studio or personal training business that invests in local SEO here can usually get visible within a few months.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees no lock in contracts. Month to month.</p>
