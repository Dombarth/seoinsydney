  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues on the area Bay Road or health practices in the area, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2034 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches, with higher competition in hospitality categories during warmer months. Businesses with well-optimised Google Business Profiles and strong review histories can see faster initial improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the eastern suburbs including Randwick, Bondi, Maroubra, Kingsford, Clovelly, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a beachside eastern suburbs community within the 2034 postcode, centred on the beach and the area Bay Road. The beach draws visitors year-round and is the southern endpoint of the Bondi to the area coastal walk, one of Sydney's most popular walking routes. The area Bay Road runs from the beach up to the Spot Junction commercial area on St Pauls Street, with cafes, restaurants, bars, and retail lining both sides. The suburb has a mix of long-term residents, young professionals, and a transient population including backpackers and international students, many drawn by the beach lifestyle and proximity to UNSW and the hospital precinct in Randwick.</p>

<p>The beachside location creates seasonal search demand patterns that differ from inland eastern suburbs. Hospitality and beach-related searches increase significantly during warmer months, while trades, health services, and professional services maintain consistent demand throughout the year. For businesses on the area Bay Road, search visibility captures both local residents and the visitor traffic from the coastal walk. A structured local SEO campaign accounts for these seasonal patterns and ensures consistent visibility across both peak and off-peak periods.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality businesses on the area Bay Road or health practices in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
