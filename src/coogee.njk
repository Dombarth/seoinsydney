<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Coogee and across the southeastern beaches. We've been working with businesses around Coogee Bay Road, Arden Street, Brook Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Coogee has always had a strong community feel with a mix of locals, backpackers and families that creates a unique commercial environment.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Coogee is a beachside suburb with a concentrated commercial strip along Coogee Bay Road. Theres cafes, restaurants, pubs, real estate agencies, medical practices and a variety of service businesses all catering to a residential population that values convenience. For businesses in Coogee the search behaviour is very local. People search for services near the beach or along Coogee Bay Road specifically rather than broader eastern suburbs terms. Its a suburb where ranking for local searches translates directly into foot traffic because the commercial area is compact and walkable.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a physiotherapy clinic near Arden Street in mid 2021 that had been running for about six years. Three physios specialising in sports injuries and post surgical rehabilitation. They were getting most of their patients from orthopaedic surgeon referrals which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was a basic WordPress site with three pages and their Google Business Profile had the wrong primary category. We rebuilt the site with individual treatment and condition pages, sorted out the GBP with proper sports physiotherapy categories, created content targeting specific injury and rehabilitation searches and built links from sports medicine directories. Over about seven months their self referred patients went from about four per week to around ten. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that work in house including the physiotherapy content which a lot of other agencies struggle to write accurately.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in Coogee is seasonal. Summer brings a surge of visitors and the search volume for dining and activities peaks. But the cafes and restaurants in Coogee still need consistent customers through winter. A hospitality business in Coogee that maintains strong local SEO year round can capture the steady local demand that keeps them profitable outside of the peak months.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Coogee businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For physiotherapy and allied health practices in Coogee its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many conditions and treatments are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Coogee clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Coogee strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Coogee area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
