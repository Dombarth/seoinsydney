<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Dee Why and across the northern beaches. We've been working with businesses around Pittwater Road, Howard Avenue, Oaks Avenue, The Strand and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Dee Why has been going through a significant transformation with the high rise developments and the upgraded beachfront precinct changing the character of the area.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Dee Why is the commercial hub of the northern beaches with a growing population and an expanding range of businesses. Theres a mix of retail, hospitality, medical practices, real estate agencies, trade services and professional services firms. For businesses in Dee Why the market is becoming more competitive as the population grows and new businesses open to serve the apartment dwellers moving into the area. Its a suburb where local SEO is becoming increasingly important because the search behaviour is shifting as younger residents move in and search for services online rather than relying on word of mouth.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a real estate agency near Pittwater Road in late 2021 that had been operating in Dee Why for about six years. Two agents and an admin team. They were getting most of their vendor leads from letterbox drops and local newspaper advertising which is where most of their listings had always come from. Their website was a generic property portal template with no area specific content and their Google Business Profile was basic. We rebuilt the site with suburb profile pages for Dee Why, Curl Curl and North Curl Curl, created content around the northern beaches property market and built links from property industry publications and local directories. Over about eight months their organic appraisal requests went from about one per month to around six. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the property market content which a lot of other agencies on the northern beaches outsource.</p>

<p>The beachfront dining scene in Dee Why has improved significantly with the new developments along The Strand. Restaurants and cafes in the precinct are competing for both local and visitor traffic. A hospitality business in Dee Why that invests in local SEO can capture the searches from people across the northern beaches who are looking for dining options near the beach.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Dee Why businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For real estate agencies and professional services firms in Dee Why its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many suburbs and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Dee Why business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Dee Why area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
