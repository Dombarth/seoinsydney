<h2>How We Work in Dee Why</h2>

<p>We worked with a physiotherapy practice near the town centre that had been operating for about four years. They had a small patient base and were looking to grow beyond referrals. Their website was a template with basic contact information. Over about four months we rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages, optimised the Google Business Profile and built citations across health directories. The practice started appearing in local search results and receiving new patient bookings consistently.</p>
