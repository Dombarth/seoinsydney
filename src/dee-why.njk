<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Dee Why and the central northern beaches area. Dee Why has developed into the commercial hub of the northern beaches. The area around Pittwater Road, Howard Avenue and the Dee Why Grand shopping area has a strong concentration of medical practices, retail businesses, hospitality venues and professional services firms.</p>

<p>The medical and dental market in Dee Why is competitive. The Dee Why town centre has attracted a significant number of health practitioners because of its accessibility and proximity to the beach lifestyle. Dentists, physiotherapists, chiropractors, psychologists and GPs all compete for the local population's attention in search results.</p>

<p>We worked with a chiropractic clinic on Pittwater Road that had been operating for about five years. They had a decent patient base from local referrals but their online presence was weak. The website was a template site with stock photos and generic content that could have belonged to any chiropractic clinic anywhere. We rebuilt the website with content specific to the conditions they treated, the techniques they used and the population they served. We optimised the GBP, cleaned up directory listings and built links from chiropractic associations and northern beaches health directories. Within about six months they were ranking for chiropractic searches across Dee Why, Curl Curl, Brookvale and Narrabeen. Their new patient enquiries from organic search went from a couple per month to about eight or nine.</p>

<p>For the retail and hospitality businesses in the Dee Why town centre the recent development and population growth has increased both demand and competition. New apartment buildings have brought more residents searching locally for everything from coffee to dry cleaning. Businesses that maintain a strong GBP and local search presence benefit directly from this growth.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
