faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For retail businesses here Grand or hospitality venues in the beachfront area, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,500. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2099 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. Businesses in less competitive categories like trades and specialist health services can see results sooner."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the Northern Beaches including Brookvale, Manly, Narrabeen, Collaroy, Curl Curl, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a central Northern Beaches suburb within the 2099 postcode, functioning as a commercial hub for the mid-Northern Beaches area. The suburb has a beachfront precinct along The Strand, a town centre with the area Grand shopping centre, and a mix of residential apartments and houses. The Northern Beaches Hospital, which opened in 2018 in nearby Frenchs Forest, has increased healthcare-related commercial activity in the surrounding area. The area's position between Manly to the south and the upper Northern Beaches to the north makes it a natural services hub for the region.</p>

<p>The commercial density of the area creates a defined local search market. Retail, hospitality, health services, and trades businesses serve both the local residential population and the broader mid-Northern Beaches catchment. The beachfront precinct generates seasonal hospitality demand, while the town centre commercial area maintains year-round search volume for everyday services. Northern Beaches residents typically search for services within their region rather than travelling to other parts of Sydney, which means businesses with strong local search visibility here capture enquiries from a loyal and geographically defined customer base.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
