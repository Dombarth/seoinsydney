            <h2>Know What You Need Before You Start</h2>
            <p>Different businesses need different things. Before talking to agencies, have a rough idea of your situation:</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Local visibility:</strong> You need to appear in local searches and Google Maps. Focus on agencies strong in local SEO.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> Your site has speed, mobile, or crawl problems. You need technical SEO expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>Content gaps:</strong> You don't have pages for your main services or locations. You need content development.</li>
                <li><strong>Authority building:</strong> You have content but aren't ranking. You need link building and authority work.</li>
                <li><strong>Full campaign:</strong> You need everything. Look for agencies that do comprehensive SEO.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some agencies specialise. Others do everything. Knowing what you need helps you evaluate whether their approach fits your situation.</p>

<!-- Questions to Ask Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Questions to Ask Any SEO Agency</h2>
            
            <h3>What exactly will you do each month?</h3>
            <p>Good agencies can tell you specifically. "We'll create X pages, build Y links, fix Z technical issues." Vague answers like "optimisation" and "link building" without specifics are a warning sign.</p>
            
            <h3>How do you report results?</h3>
            <p>You should get regular reports showing rankings, traffic, and conversions. Ask to see a sample report. If it's full of jargon and doesn't connect to business outcomes, that's a problem.</p>
            
            <h3>Can you show me work for similar businesses?</h3>
            <p>Not just case studies with percentages. Actual examples of pages they've created, links they've built, technical fixes they've made. If they can't show work, be sceptical.</p>
            
            <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
            <p>Honest agencies give realistic timelines. "Three to six months for meaningful movement" is reasonable. "First page in 30 days" is either a lie or involves risky tactics.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if it doesn't work?</h3>
            <p>SEO doesn't always work. Ask what they do if rankings don't improve. Good agencies have a plan for this. They'll try different approaches or tell you honestly if the goal isn't achievable.</p>
            
            <h3>Do you outsource any work?</h3>
            <p>Many agencies outsource content or link building offshore. This isn't always bad, but you should know. Cheap offshore content often reads poorly. Cheap link building can get you penalised.</p>

<!-- Warning Signs Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Warning Signs to Avoid</h2>
            
            <h3>Guaranteed Rankings</h3>
            <p>No one can guarantee specific rankings. Google doesn't work that way. Agencies that guarantee rankings are either lying or using tactics that risk penalties.</p>
            
            <h3>Secret Methods</h3>
            <p>"We can't tell you exactly what we do" means either they're doing something against Google's guidelines or they don't want you to know how simple it is.</p>
            
            <h3>They Don't Rank Themselves</h3>
            <p>If an agency can't rank their own site for SEO-related searches, how will they rank yours? Check if they appear for "SEO Sydney" or similar terms.</p>
            
            <h3>Long Lock-In Contracts</h3>
            <p>SEO takes time, but you shouldn't be locked in for a year. Month-to-month or short initial contracts are safer. If they're confident in their work, they shouldn't need to trap you.</p>
            
            <h3>Cheap Pricing</h3>
            <p>Real SEO work takes time. $500 per month doesn't cover meaningful work. Either they're doing very little, outsourcing to the cheapest providers, or planning to upsell you heavily.</p>
            
            <h3>Focus on Vanity Metrics</h3>
            <p>If they talk about traffic increases without mentioning conversions, or rankings for keywords no one searches, they're focusing on numbers that don't help your business.</p>

<!-- Agency vs Consultant Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Agency vs Consultant</h2>
            <p>Both can work. The difference is usually in how they operate:</p>
            
            <h3>Agencies</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Team of specialists for different tasks</li>
                <li>Account managers handle communication</li>
                <li>Higher overhead, usually higher pricing</li>
                <li>Better for large-scale campaigns</li>
                <li>May outsource work to meet capacity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Consultants</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>You work directly with the person doing the work</li>
                <li>Lower overhead, often lower pricing</li>
                <li>Limited capacity</li>
                <li>Better for small to medium campaigns</li>
                <li>More consistent execution</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Neither is inherently better. It depends on what you need. If you want a team executing multiple workstreams, an agency makes sense. If you want direct access to the person doing the work, a consultant is better.</p>

<!-- Making Your Decision Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Making Your Decision</h2>
            <p>After talking to agencies, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Did they explain their approach clearly?</li>
                <li>Did they ask about my business and goals?</li>
                <li>Did they give realistic expectations?</li>
                <li>Do I trust them to do what they say?</li>
                <li>Can I afford to continue if it doesn't work immediately?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Good SEO agencies want to understand your business before proposing a solution. They'll ask questions. They'll give you options. They'll be honest about what's achievable.</p>
            
            <p>If you feel pressured, confused, or like you're being sold, keep looking.</p>
