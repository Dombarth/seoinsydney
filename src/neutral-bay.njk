faqs:
  - q: "How much does local business SEO cost?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses can start from around $1200 per month. In the case of hospitality businesses on Military Road or health practices it may range from $1200 to $1800 per month. The prices of these keywords vary by competition level and are quoted before the work begins."
  - q: "What is the time frame of SEO?"
    a: "Most local businesses will start appearing for relevant searches within a three to six month period. Local service searches in postcode 2089 have moderate competition. In particular, hospitality and retail services along Military Road are more competitive. In contrast, health and professional services are less competitive."
  - q: "Do you do business with companies outside of the region?"
    a: "Yes, I have businesses in the lower North Shore areas such as North Sydney, Crows Nest, Mosman, Cremorne and Kirribilli as well as suburbs throughout the Sydney metropolitan area, and this method is also adapted to the search space in each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month, with 30 days notice. I would recommend at least six months because SEO is a cumulative process, but we do not put you in a lock-in contract. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "Our bookings were mainly from existing clients. The SEO campaign brought in new clients from the local area who found us through search. That growth was steady and has continued."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>Neutral Bay lies within the Sydney postcode of 2089 and is a suburb of the lower North Shore, located between North Sydney and Mosman. The area is home to cafes, restaurants, shops and services along Military Road. The Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay is a local landmark and meeting place. Neutral Bay is predominantly a residential suburb, with some apartment buildings on Military Road and houses behind them. Bus services along Military Road link the suburb to the city CBD across the Harbour Bridge, with ferry services from nearby Kurraba Point to Circular Quay.</p>

<p>The Military Road corridor through the suburb is a major commercial street and one of the busiest on the lower North Shore. The road carries pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the Harbour Bridge and Mosman, and consequently has a high concentration of shops. Military Road is also serviced by its permanent residents, who create demand for health, trades and professional services. Local SEO targets search engine web traffic from pass-through users on Military Road as well as from users in and near Cremorne searching for services in the area.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Monthly local SEO campaigns for local businesses start at $1,200/mo. An itemised written quote will be provided prior to starting work on this campaign. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to quit, you get to keep everything. And I will be running all campaigns personally versus having junior staff run them offshore.</p>
