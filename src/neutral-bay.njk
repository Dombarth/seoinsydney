<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Neutral Bay and across the lower north shore. We've been working with businesses along Military Road, Grosvenor Street, Ben Boyd Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Neutral Bay has maintained its position as one of the most reliable commercial strips on the lower north shore.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Neutral Bay has a strong village feel with a busy commercial strip along Military Road and the side streets. Theres a mix of cafes, restaurants, medical practices, dental clinics, boutique retail, real estate agencies and service businesses. For businesses in Neutral Bay the customer base is predominantly local and affluent with high expectations. Its a suburb where people search for services specifically in their area rather than travelling to the city and they expect quality results when they do. Local SEO works well here because the search intent is strong and the competition is moderate compared to larger centres.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a dental clinic near Military Road in early 2022 that had been operating for about eleven years. Two dentists and a hygienist. They had a steady patient base but were losing patients to newer practices in the area that had modern websites and active online profiles which is where most of their concern came from. Their website was outdated and their Google Business Profile had no photos and limited service information. We rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages for cosmetic, restorative and general dentistry, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and categories, created content around dental health topics and built links from dental directories and health publications. Over about seven months their new patient bookings from organic search went from about two per week to around six. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the dental content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The dining scene along Military Road in Neutral Bay is competitive but most restaurants still rely on foot traffic and word of mouth. A restaurant in Neutral Bay that invests in local SEO and manages its GBP reviews and photos properly can pick up a significant share of the dining searches from the local population who plan their evenings out by searching on their phones.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Neutral Bay businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For dental practices and medical clinics in Neutral Bay its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how many treatments and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Neutral Bay business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Neutral Bay area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
