  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses generally start at around $1200/month. Campaigns for hospitality venues on Military Road or health practices may start at around $1200-$1800/month. Pricing varies per level of competition and keyword range, and is quoted before work starts."
  - q: "How long does SEO take to work?"
    a: "Most local companies gain rankings within three to six months of starting. Local service searches around the 2089 postcode are moderately competitive. The hospitality and retail sectors on Military Road face greater competition, while health and professional services are less competitive."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside of the region?"
    a: "Yes, I work with businesses across the lower North Shore including North Sydney, Crows Nest, Mosman, Cremorne, Kirribilli and every suburb across the Sydney metropolitan area, as my method is also adapted to the search space in each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I would recommend at least six months, because SEO results compound over time. However, we do not lock you into any contract. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "Our bookings were mainly from existing clients. The SEO campaign brought in new clients from the local area who found us through search. That growth was steady and has continued."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>Neutral Bay is in the 2089 postcode area, and is a lower North Shore suburb between North Sydney and Mosman. The local village precinct is mainly on Military Road, with cafes, restaurants, shops and services. The Oaks Hotel at Neutral Bay is an important local landmark and meeting place. The suburb is broadly residential, with some apartment blocks along Military Road, and houses behind. Bus services on Military Road provide connections to the CBD via the Harbour Bridge, while ferry services are provided from nearby Kurraba Point to Circular Quay.</p>

<p>Military Road through the suburb is one of the busiest commercial strips of the lower North Shore, carrying pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the Harbour Bridge and Mosman. Commercial density along the route creates intense competition in the hospitality and retail sectors. A permanent local population provides consistent demand for health services, and trades and professional services. Local SEO captures traffic from pass-through users on Military Road as well as users in the Cremorne area and surrounding suburbs who are searching for services local to where they are.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>For local businesses, local SEO campaigns start from $1,200/month. You will receive a written quote with an itemized breakdown before we start. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I personally manage each campaign directly, versus handing it off to junior staff offshore.</p>

<h2>What Our SEO Campaigns Cover</h2>

<h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>I also audit your GBP listing, and put the correct categories into place, add the right attributes, set up posts, and even the Q and A section of the listing. Most businesses that I see have this setup wrong or not at all.</p>

<h3>Local Citation Building</h3>
<p>I want to make sure your name, address, and phone number are consistent everywhere. I clean up the inconsistencies in Australian directories and build citations that improve local rankings.</p>

<h3>On-Page and Technical SEO</h3>
<p>Site speed, crawl scalability, internal linking, schema, Core Web Vitals. All the boring stuff that no one wants to hear about but is there when you need it.</p>

<h3>Content and Keyword Strategy</h3>
<p>Keyword research of your suburb and service area. Optimizing of pages. Plan your content based on what people actually type into Google, not what you think they search for.</p>

            <h3>Audit and Research</h3>
            <p>I will analyze your website, Google Business Profile, citations, and what your competitors are doing in this area. It typically takes me about three days to conduct an audit. Instead of a sales pitch, you get a written report.</p>

            <h3>Strategy and Implementation</h3>
            <p>I build a campaign around the keywords and local signals that will actually move the needle, then implement technical fixes, content marketing and citation building. You deal with me personally. I do not delegate work to junior staff.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Reporting and Iteration</h3>
            <p>Instead, every month you get a report with rankings, traffic and leads. No dashboard with graphs and no context. An actual report that explains what happened and what I am doing next. Most of my clients stay for years because they can see what is being done.</p>
