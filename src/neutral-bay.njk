<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Neutral Bay and across the lower north shore including Cremorne and Kirribilli. Neutral Bay is a well established residential and commercial area. The strip along Military Road has a strong mix of retail, hospitality, health services and professional services all serving a local population that tends to research and purchase locally.</p>

<p>Military Road is the backbone of commercial activity here. Restaurants, cafes, boutiques, hairdressers, dental practices, optometrists and a range of professional service firms line the road from Cremorne through to the Neutral Bay junction. The competition for search visibility is moderate — its not as intense as the CBD or North Sydney but there are enough businesses in most categories that you can't just rely on having a website and expect to be found.</p>

<p>We worked with a personal training studio near the Neutral Bay junction that had been operating for about two years. The owner had built a decent client base through Instagram and referrals but was finding it hard to scale beyond word of mouth. Their website was essentially a single page with contact details and an Instagram feed embed. We built a proper website with pages for their key services — personal training, group classes, corporate fitness, post natal training — optimised the GBP and built a handful of links from fitness directories and local business listings. Within about five months they were appearing in the map pack and organic results for fitness and personal training searches across Neutral Bay, Cremorne and Mosman. The owner said she was getting about five or six new enquiries per week from search compared to maybe one or two before.</p>

<p>For the restaurant and hospitality businesses on Military Road the competition comes from the sheer density of options. There are probably 40 to 50 restaurants and cafes within a kilometre. Local SEO and GBP optimisation make the difference between being found and being invisible.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts, month to month with 30 days notice.</p>
