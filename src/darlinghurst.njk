faqs:
  - q: "How much does it cost?"
    a: "Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month. If you are a medical practice or a restaurant on Oxford Street where the competition is heavier it is usually $1,500 to $2,200. I send you a written quote before I start anything so you know exactly what you are paying for."
  - q: "How long before you see results?"
    a: "Most businesses see real movement in three to six months. But GBP work can show results faster than that, I had a cafe on Stanley Street that went from not showing up in the map pack at all to top three within about seven weeks just from sorting out their categories and getting the citations right."
  - q: "Do you work outside Darlinghurst?"
    a: "Yes. Most of my work is in the inner east and CBD because that is where I started but I work across Sydney, Surry Hills and Kings Cross and Potts Point and Paddington and further out too. I only take one client per industry in each area so I am never competing against myself."
  - q: "Is there a contract?"
    a: "No. There is no contract or anything like that, you give me 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content and the backlinks and the GBP improvements, I dont pull anything down or hold anything hostage."
testimonialQuote: "The leads are completely different now, before we were getting a lot of price shoppers ringing up for quotes and not committing to anything but now people call already knowing what they want and they ask when we can start, its been a massive change."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters Here</h2>

<p>Darlinghurst and Surry Hills share the 2010 postcode and that messes with local rankings more than most people realise, Google sometimes shows Surry Hills businesses in Darlinghurst results and the other way around. Oxford Street runs from the CBD right through to Paddington and that is where most of the foot traffic and commercial activity is, so if your business is on or near Oxford Street your local SEO has to account for that. Victoria Street and Stanley Street have a lot of the dining and smaller retail, Stanley Street especially for Italian restaurants and cafes.</p>

<p>There is something like 40 or 50 restaurants within a ten minute walk of each other and probably just as many GP practices and allied health clinics competing for the same search terms. If you search dentist Darlinghurst or restaurant Darlinghurst you will see how crowded it is, there are a lot of businesses going after the same three map pack spots. For a restaurant or bar on Oxford Street your Google Business Profile is where most of your walk-in traffic comes from, people search on their phone and pick whoever shows up first.</p>

<p>The postcode overlap with Surry Hills is the first thing I sort out because if Google is confused about which suburb your business sits in you are fighting for rankings in the wrong area.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month and that covers everything, the GBP work and the on-page SEO and the citations and the monthly reporting. Medical practices and restaurants tend to cost more because the competition is heavier, those campaigns usually sit around $1,500 to $2,200 a month. Written quote with full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>There is no contract or anything like that, if you want to stop you just give me 30 days notice and that is it. I do the work myself, I dont hand it off to junior staff or send it offshore, and you can ring me directly if you have a question about anything. And if you do stop the content stays on your site, the backlinks stay, the GBP improvements stay, I dont pull anything down.</p>
