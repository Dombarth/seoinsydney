<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Darlinghurst and across the eastern fringe of the city. We've been working with businesses around Oxford Street, Victoria Street, Stanley Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Darlinghurst has always had a strong independent business culture that makes it different from other inner city suburbs.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Darlinghurst has a dense mix of hospitality, health and medical practices, creative businesses and boutique retail. Theres a particularly high concentration of allied health practitioners along Oxford Street and Victoria Street including psychologists, physiotherapists, GPs and specialist medical practices. For businesses in Darlinghurst the competition is intense within a small geographic area which means ranking locally requires targeted work rather than broad campaigns. Its a suburb where specificity matters more than volume.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a psychology practice near Victoria Street in mid 2021 that had three psychologists and a clinical director. They'd been operating in Darlinghurst for about seven years with most of their referrals coming from GPs and psychiatrists which is where most of their patients had always come from. Their website was a WordPress template with a homepage and an about page and they had no Google Business Profile at all. We built out individual therapist pages, condition specific content pages, sorted out the GBP with proper categories and started building links from psychology directories and health publications. Over about six months their self referred patients went from about two a week to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all the content and link building in house which a lot of other agencies in this area don't really do properly.</p>

<p>The bar and restaurant scene along Stanley Street and Crown Street is competitive but interesting. Theres a mix of longstanding Darlinghurst institutions and newer openings and the search behaviour splits between locals looking for their regular spots and visitors looking for something specific. A Darlinghurst restaurant that invests in local SEO and manages its GBP reviews properly can stand out because most of the competition is relying entirely on social media and word of mouth.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Darlinghurst businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical and allied health practices in Darlinghurst its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how many practitioners and conditions are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Darlinghurst business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Darlinghurst area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
