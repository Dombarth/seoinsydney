  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues or medical practices in competitive categories, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,200. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The area shares the 2010 postcode with Surry Hills, creating overlap in local search results. For hospitality businesses, Google Business Profile optimisation can produce visible improvements faster than organic rankings."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Sydney including Surry Hills, Kings Cross, Potts Point, Paddington, the CBD, and all suburbs in the metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the search landscape specific to each business and location."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner-city suburb east of the Sydney CBD, sharing the 2010 postcode with Surry Hills. The area is bounded by Oxford Street to the south, William Street and Kings Cross to the north, and Victoria Street running through the heart of the suburb. The area has a high density of restaurants, bars, cafes, medical practices, and creative businesses. Oxford Street remains the primary commercial strip, connecting the CBD to Paddington, while Victoria Street and Stanley Street form secondary dining and retail corridors.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate to high for hospitality and health-related terms. The area has a significant concentration of GP practices, specialist medical providers, and allied health professionals that compete for health-related local searches. For hospitality venues along Oxford Street and the surrounding streets, Google Business Profile visibility directly impacts foot traffic and bookings.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>The medical and health sector generates strong search demand here. GP practices, dermatologists, psychologists, and allied health providers along Oxford Street, Crown Street, and the surrounding area compete for suburb-specific and postcode-specific health searches. For medical practices, a well-optimised Google Business Profile with accurate opening hours, services listed, and genuine patient reviews is the foundation of local search visibility.</p>

<p>The hospitality sector along Oxford Street, Stanley Street, and Victoria Street creates competitive demand for dining and nightlife searches. The area's proximity to Kings Cross and Potts Point means search results often overlap across these areas, and businesses need to be visible across multiple location-based queries to capture the full range of potential customers.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For medical practices or hospitality venues in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,200. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
