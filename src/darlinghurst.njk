<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Darlinghurst and along the Oxford Street and Victoria Street corridors. Darlinghurst has one of the densest concentrations of hospitality businesses in Sydney and the competition for local search visibility is significant.</p>

<p>The area around Oxford Street, Crown Street and the blocks running down to Kings Cross has a very specific business profile. Bars, restaurants, cocktail lounges, wellness clinics, gyms, tattoo studios and a growing number of health practitioners particularly in the allied health space. A lot of these businesses are small owner operated places that rely heavily on walk in traffic but underestimate how much business they're losing by not showing up in Google.</p>

<p>We picked up a cocktail bar on Oxford Street in early 2023 that had been open for about two years. They had great reviews, a solid Instagram following and a website that was essentially a single page with an embedded Instagram feed. No menu page, no about page, no structured data and the Google Business Profile had the wrong opening hours. We built them a proper website, optimised the GBP, got their listings consistent across about 25 directories and created content around their events and food menu. Within five months they were showing up in the map pack for bar and cocktail related searches across the inner city.</p>

<p>For health and wellness businesses in Darlinghurst the market is also competitive. There are physiotherapists, chiropractors, psychologists and GP practices all within a few blocks of each other and most of them are competing for the same local search terms. The ones who have invested in even basic SEO tend to dominate because the majority haven't done anything beyond setting up a Google listing.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. No setup fees, no contracts. Month to month with 30 days notice. Written quote before anything starts.</p>

<p>All SEO work is carried out by our Sydney based team. We don't send work offshore at any point.</p>
