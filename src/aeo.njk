            <h2>AEO vs Traditional SEO</h2>
            <p>AEO builds on traditional SEO but adds specific considerations:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Content Structure:</strong> Traditional SEO focuses on keywords; AEO focuses on question-answer patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Format:</strong> AEO requires content in formats search engines can extract: lists, tables, definitions</li>
                <li><strong>Precision:</strong> AEO rewards concise, specific answers over lengthy content</li>
                <li><strong>Schema:</strong> AEO relies more heavily on structured data markup (FAQ, HowTo, Q&A)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AEO complements rather than replaces traditional <a href="/">SEO</a> work. Technical SEO and content quality remain the foundation.</p>

            <h2>Types of Direct Answers</h2>
            <p>Search engines display direct answers in several formats:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Paragraph Snippets:</strong> Brief text answers to definitional or explanatory queries</li>
                <li><strong>List Snippets:</strong> Numbered or bulleted lists for process or collection queries</li>
                <li><strong>Table Snippets:</strong> Data in table format for comparison or specification queries</li>
                <li><strong>AI Overviews:</strong> Synthesised answers drawing from multiple sources</li>
