faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Rozelle business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Rozelle businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting."
  - q: "Is SEO worth it for a small business in Rozelle?"
    a: "Rozelle is a relatively compact village area with moderate search competition. For small businesses like health practitioners, cafes and local services, even a modest investment in local SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation can produce noticeable results because fewer competitors have invested in it."
  - q: "How does the Rozelle market compare to Balmain or Leichhardt?"
    a: "Rozelle sits between Balmain and Leichhardt and shares some search overlap with both suburbs. The competition is generally lighter than in Balmain village and less concentrated than Norton Street in Leichhardt. This makes it a practical area for businesses to build organic visibility without competing against a large number of established sites."
  - q: "Do you work with trade businesses in Rozelle?"
    a: "Yes. Rozelle has a number of trade businesses along Victoria Road and in the surrounding streets. For trade businesses, service-area-based SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation covering the suburbs they serve are typically the most effective approach."

<h2>The Search Landscape in Rozelle</h2>

<p>Rozelle sits between Balmain and Leichhardt in the inner west. Its commercial activity is concentrated along Darling Street and Victoria Road, with a mix of cafes, restaurants, health practitioners, retail shops and trade businesses serving the local population and surrounding suburbs.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Rozelle:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Village-style commercial strip with local-focused businesses</li>
    <li>Health and wellness practitioners serving the inner west population</li>
    <li>Hospitality businesses competing with nearby Balmain and Leichhardt venues</li>
    <li>Trade businesses along Victoria Road with wider service areas</li>
    <li>Moderate search competition that responds well to consistent local SEO</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Rozelle</h2>

<p>We worked with a pilates studio on Darling Street that had been operating for about three years. They had a small but loyal client base and most of their new members came through Instagram and word of mouth. Their website was a single page with class times and a booking link but no content about their approach, practitioner qualifications or the specific pilates methods they offered. Over about four months we rebuilt the site with dedicated pages for each class type, optimised their Google Business Profile and built citations across health and fitness directories. The studio started appearing in local search results and receiving new enquiries from people in the area who had not heard of them before.</p>

<p>For trade businesses along Victoria Road, the SEO approach is different. These businesses typically serve a wider area across the inner west and beyond. Service-area targeting through Google Business Profile and location-specific service pages are the primary drivers, rather than suburb-specific local search.</p>

    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
