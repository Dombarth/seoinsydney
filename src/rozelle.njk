  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For health practices, hospitality venues, or trades businesses in the area, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2039 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. Businesses with well-optimised Google Business Profiles can see faster results, particularly for trades and health services where near me searches are common."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner west including Balmain, Leichhardt, Lilyfield, Drummoyne, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner west suburb within the 2039 postcode, sitting between Balmain to the north and Leichhardt to the south. Darling Street continues through the area as the primary commercial corridor, connecting to Balmain's retail strip and the Victoria Road intersection. The suburb has a mix of established terrace houses, heritage properties, and newer apartment developments. The local markets at the area Public School are a significant local institution, and the former Callan Park grounds (now the local parklands and Sydney College of the Arts site) form a large green space on the suburb's eastern edge along Iron Cove.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate. The suburb functions as part of the broader Balmain and inner west commercial area, and local searches often overlap with Balmain and Leichhardt results. For businesses on Darling Street and Victoria Road, visibility in local search results captures enquiries from the residential population across the Balmain peninsula and surrounding inner west suburbs. Many small businesses here have not invested in SEO, creating opportunity for those that do.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
