<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Rozelle and the surrounding inner west areas. Rozelle sits at the western end of the Balmain peninsula with the main commercial activity along Darling Street and Victoria Road. The area has a quieter feel than neighbouring Balmain but there's a solid mix of local businesses serving both residents and people passing through.</p>

<p>The business profile in Rozelle is mostly cafes, restaurants, small retail shops, a couple of pubs and an increasing number of home services businesses. Theres also the Rozelle Collectors Markets which brings regular visitor traffic on weekends. A lot of the commercial properties along Victoria Road house trade businesses, building companies and auto services that serve the wider Sydney area rather than just the local market.</p>

<p>We picked up a building company based in Rozelle in mid 2023 that did residential renovations and small commercial fitouts across the inner west and lower north shore. They had a decent website but it was all about them and had nothing about their actual services or the areas they worked in. No service pages, no location content, no project case studies and their Google Business Profile was barely set up. We rebuilt the content with individual service pages, added project descriptions with before and after details, cleaned up their online citations and built links from construction industry directories. Within about six months their organic enquiries went from about four or five a month to around fifteen.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses along Darling Street the challenge is similar to Balmain. Small search volumes but high intent. Showing up in the map pack for cafe or restaurant searches in the area can be the difference between a quiet Tuesday lunch and a full one.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees, no contracts. Month to month with 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All work done by our Sydney based team.</p>
