<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Rozelle and across the inner west. We've been working with businesses along Darling Street, Victoria Road, Elliott Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Rozelle has been changing quite a bit with the Bays Precinct development starting to reshape the area.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Rozelle is a smaller commercial market than neighbouring Balmain but it has a loyal local customer base and a growing number of businesses along the Darling Street strip that extends from Balmain through to Rozelle. Theres cafes, restaurants, antique dealers, wellness practitioners, tradespeople and a handful of professional services firms. For businesses in Rozelle the opportunity is in capturing searches from the local population and the increasing number of people moving into the area as new developments come online. Its a suburb where the competition for SEO is still low which means early movers get an advantage.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a plumbing company based in Rozelle in mid 2020 that serviced the entire inner west. Three plumbers and an apprentice. They had been running for about six years and were getting most of their work from Hipages and word of mouth which is where most of their jobs had always come from. The Hipages leads were expensive and inconsistent. Their website was a single page with a phone number. We built out a proper site with service pages for emergency plumbing, blocked drains, hot water systems and gas fitting, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built citations across trade directories. Over about seven months their direct calls from organic search went from almost nothing to about fifteen per week across the inner west. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the trade specific content which a lot of other agencies struggle to write properly.</p>

<p>The Rozelle Markets have been a local institution for years and the surrounding businesses benefit from that weekend traffic. But for six days of the week those businesses need other ways to get found. A Rozelle business that invests in local SEO and manages its online presence properly can build consistent visibility that doesn't depend on weekend market crowds.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Rozelle businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For trade businesses and service companies in Rozelle its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many service areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Rozelle business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Rozelle area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
