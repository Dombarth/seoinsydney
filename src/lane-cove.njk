faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Lane Cove business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Lane Cove businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting."
  - q: "Is SEO worth it for a small business in Lane Cove?"
    a: "Lane Cove has a compact village commercial area with moderate search competition. For small businesses, even basic local SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation can create noticeable separation from competitors because relatively few businesses in the area have invested in it properly."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO in Lane Cove?"
    a: "Lane Cove has lighter search competition than larger North Shore centres like Chatswood or North Sydney. The village area has a focused business mix, and SEO investment tends to produce visible results within three to five months."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses in Lane Cove West and the industrial area?"
    a: "Yes. Lane Cove has both a village commercial area and an industrial precinct in Lane Cove West. For businesses in the industrial area, the SEO approach focuses on service-area targeting and industry-specific searches rather than purely local terms."

<p>We provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Lane Cove and the surrounding area on the North Shore. We have been working with businesses in the Lane Cove village precinct, along Longueville Road and in the Lane Cove West industrial area since 2017. Lane Cove has a well-established village character with a mix of hospitality, health, retail and service businesses.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock-in contracts and local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is handled in-house by our Sydney-based team.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape in Lane Cove</h2>

<p>Lane Cove's commercial activity is split between the village precinct around Longueville Road and Burns Bay Road, and the industrial area in Lane Cove West. The village serves the local residential population with hospitality, health, retail and professional services. The industrial area has a different search profile focused on trade, manufacturing and business services.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Lane Cove:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Village commercial strip with hospitality, health and retail businesses</li>
    <li>Dental, medical and allied health practices serving the local population</li>
    <li>Industrial precinct in Lane Cove West with trade and B2B businesses</li>
    <li>Local service businesses targeting the North Shore residential market</li>
    <li>Moderate search competition with good opportunity for optimised businesses</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Lane Cove</h2>

<p>We worked with a cafe in the Lane Cove village that had been trading for about four years. They had a loyal regular customer base but were not appearing in search results when people in the area searched for cafes or brunch options. Their Google Business Profile was set up but had outdated hours, no menu information and few photos. Over about three months we optimised the GBP with proper categories, updated photos, menu highlights and regular posting. We also set up a basic website with proper local SEO targeting. The cafe started appearing in the map pack for local cafe searches and saw an increase in customers who mentioned finding them through Google.</p>

<p>For businesses in the Lane Cove West industrial area, the approach is different. These businesses typically serve customers across a wider geographic area, so service-area targeting through Google Business Profile and industry-specific content are the primary focus rather than local village-style search.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service pages</li>
