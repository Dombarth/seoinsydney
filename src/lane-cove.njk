faqs:
  - q: "How much does it cost?"
    a: "$1,200 a month for most local campaigns in Lane Cove. Health practices and trades businesses in competitive categories might be $1,500 to $1,800. Ring 0400 454 859 for a written quote with the full breakdown before anything starts."
  - q: "How long before you see results?"
    a: "Three to six months for most businesses. But GBP work can move faster, a dental practice on Burns Bay Road went from not showing up in the map pack at all to top 3 within about six weeks just from getting the category and citations sorted out. The 2066 postcode has moderate competition so things tend to move a bit quicker here than in somewhere like Chatswood or North Sydney."
  - q: "Do you work outside Lane Cove?"
    a: "Yes. Most of the work is on the lower North Shore because that is where Dom started but there are clients across Sydney, Chatswood and St Leonards and North Sydney and Longueville and Greenwich and further out too. Only one client per industry in each area so there is no conflict."
  - q: "Is there a contract?"
    a: "No. 30 days notice if you want to stop. Content stays on your site, backlinks stay, GBP improvements stay. Nothing gets pulled down and nothing gets held hostage."
testimonialQuote: "We had been spending about $2500 a month on Google Ads for years and the cost per lead just kept going up and up, switching to SEO took longer to get going but the leads are better now and we are paying less per lead than we ever did with ads, took about 5 months before we really noticed the difference but it has been worth it."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters in Lane Cove</h2>

<p>Lane Cove is in the 2066 postcode on the lower North Shore and most of the commercial activity sits along Burns Bay Road and Longueville Road, it is a small strip but there is a good amount of everything packed in there, cafes and restaurants and health practitioners and retail all within walking distance. Chatswood is just up the road to the north and Greenwich and Longueville are to the south and then you have got Lane Cove National Park on the western side, so people who live here tend to shop and eat locally.</p>

<p>The Plaza is the main shopping centre and then you have got the village strip around it with the cafes and the restaurants and a bunch of health practitioners, dentists and physios and GPs and allied health. It is mostly families, a lot of established houses and then some newer apartment blocks that have gone up in the last ten years or so, and that mix of older houses and apartments is actually relevant for SEO because the homeowners search differently to the apartment renters, the homeowners search for things like plumber Lane Cove and the renters just call the real estate agent.</p>

<p>People in Lane Cove search locally. If someone needs a dentist or a physio or a plumber they type dentist Lane Cove or plumber Lane Cove into Google, they dont search for dentist lower North Shore or dentist Sydney, and that is why your Google Business Profile and your website have to be set up to target that suburb level search. Burns Bay Road is walkable and people pop in and out of the shops on foot, so if your business shows up in the map pack when someone searches from their phone while they are walking around the village you are going to get foot traffic from that.</p>

<p>The houses in Lane Cove are older and they need maintenance, gutters and roofing and painting and pest control and renovations, and the properties backing onto the National Park get extra pest issues and tree work too. So there is consistent demand for trades and home services and the businesses that show up first in local search get the calls.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month and that covers everything, the keyword research and the on-page work and the GBP management and the citations and a written report every month. Written quote with full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>There is no contract, you give 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content and the backlinks and the GBP work, nothing gets pulled down. Dom does the work directly and you can ring him on 0400 454 859 if you have a question, you are NOT dealing with a junior account manager.</p>

<p>Text or call 0400 454 859 and Dom will have a look at your site and tell you where you stand, no charge for that.</p>

<h2>What the SEO Campaigns Cover</h2>

<h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>Most businesses in Lane Cove have the wrong primary category on their Google Business Profile or they are missing attributes that affect whether they show up in the map pack. Dom goes through the listing and fixes the categories and adds the attributes and sets up the posts and the Q and A section. Sounds basic but this is the number one reason Lane Cove businesses dont show up in local results and it is the first thing Dom checks on every new campaign.</p>

<h3>Citations</h3>
<p>Your business name and address and phone number have to match across every directory. Sounds obvious but you would be surprised how many Lane Cove businesses have an old phone number on 6 or 7 directories and the current one on their website and Google does not know which is right. Dom checks about 43 directories and fixes every mismatch and then builds citations on the ones that actually carry weight for local rankings on the lower North Shore.</p>

<h3>Technical SEO</h3>
<p>Site speed and crawl errors and internal linking and schema markup and Core Web Vitals. Nobody wants to hear about this stuff. But if your Lane Cove website takes eight seconds to load on mobile then the content and the link building is not going to do much, Google uses page speed as a ranking factor and Screaming Frog picks up crawl issues you cannot see just by looking at the site.</p>

<h3>Content and Keywords</h3>
<p>The keyword research is based on what people in Lane Cove actually type into Google and sometimes that is very different to what business owners assume. A physio practice here wanted to rank for physiotherapy Lane Cove but when Dom checked in Ahrefs most of the volume was on back pain Lane Cove and sports physio Lane Cove and the practice had zero pages targeting any of those terms! That practice ranks top 3 for both now.</p>

    <p><strong>"Dom found that our Google Business Profile had the wrong category set and half our citations had an old address from when we were on Longueville Road, we moved to Burns Bay Road 3 years ago and never updated any of it. Rankings started moving within about 6 weeks once that was all sorted!"</strong></p>

The audit at the start took about a week which was a bit longer than expected but Dom explained why and the report was detailed so fair enough. Would recommend."</strong></p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<div class="process-steps">
    <div class="process-step">
        <div class="step-number">1</div>
        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Audit and Research</h3>
            <p>First thing is the audit. Dom goes through your website and your Google Business Profile and your citations and looks at what competitors in Lane Cove are doing and who is ranking for the terms you want and why, the whole thing takes about three to four days and at the end you get a written document with everything that was found. Not a sales pitch. Just what is wrong and what needs fixing.</p>

        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Strategy and Implementation</h3>
            <p>Then the campaign gets built based on what the audit turned up and Dom does the technical fixes and the content and the citation work directly, you are NOT dealing with a junior account manager who has never actually ranked a website in Lane Cove.</p>

        <div class="step-number">3</div>
        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Monthly Reporting</h3>
            <p>Every month there is a written report covering what got done and what moved and what did not move, and if something went backwards that goes in the report too with an explanation of why and what is being changed. Dom does not send dashboards full of graphs with no context because that is what the bigger agencies do and it tells you nothing. Most clients have been around for years and that is probably because they can see exactly where their money goes.</p>

<h2>Nearby Areas</h2>

<p>Most of the Lane Cove work overlaps with Longueville and Greenwich because they are right next door, but Dom also works with businesses in Chatswood and St Leonards and North Sydney and Artarmon and Willoughby and across the lower North Shore.</p>

<p>Most of the Lane Cove clients come through referrals from other businesses Dom works with on the lower North Shore. Dom answers his phone and is on time with deadlines and fixes things when they break and that sounds like it should be normal but a lot of SEO agencies in Sydney dont even manage that.</p>
