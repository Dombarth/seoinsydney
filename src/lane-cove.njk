<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Lane Cove and the surrounding areas of Lane Cove West, Longueville and Riverview. Lane Cove is a well established north shore suburb with a strong village feel. The commercial area along Longueville Road, Burns Bay Road and around the Lane Cove Plaza supports a range of local businesses including dental practices, cafes, restaurants, beauty salons and professional services firms.</p>

<p>The dental and health market in Lane Cove is competitive for the suburb's size. Theres a handful of dental practices, several GPs, physiotherapists and other allied health practitioners all serving a relatively contained local population. Families in Lane Cove tend to search locally and choose providers based on proximity reviews and what they can find in Google. The practices that show up in the map pack and organic results get a significant share of new patient enquiries.</p>

<p>We started working with a family dental practice on Longueville Road in late 2021. They had been operating for about ten years and had a solid patient base from the local community. But their online presence hadn't kept up. The website was a few years old with generic content about their services, the GBP had basic information and they had no visibility for dental searches beyond their practice name. We rebuilt the website with individual treatment pages for their key services — general dentistry, children's dentistry, orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry, implants — optimised the GBP with proper categories, photos and updated information and fixed inconsistencies across dental directories. Over about six months they moved into the top three of the map pack for most dental searches in Lane Cove and were appearing in organic results for dental terms across the broader north shore. New patient enquiries from search went from about two per month to roughly eight.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses along Longueville Road the competition is moderate. Lane Cove has a loyal local dining population and the cafes and restaurants that maintain a strong GBP presence tend to do well.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
