<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Lane Cove and across the lower north shore. We've been working with businesses along Longueville Road, Burns Bay Road, Rosenthal Avenue and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Lane Cove has grown with the new apartment developments along the waterfront while maintaining its village character along the main strip.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Lane Cove has a well established commercial village centred on Longueville Road with cafes, restaurants, boutique retail, medical practices, dental clinics and a range of service businesses. The population has increased significantly with the new apartments which means more customers searching for local services. For businesses in Lane Cove the competition is manageable compared to larger north shore centres like Chatswood but the search volume is still strong because residents tend to shop and dine locally. Its a suburb where local SEO delivers consistent results because the customer base is loyal and geographically focused.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a veterinary clinic near Burns Bay Road in early 2022 that had been operating for about nine years. Two vets and a nurse. They had a solid client base from the immediate area but were seeing more competition from larger vet practices opening nearby which is where most of their concerns came from. Their website was a basic template with service descriptions and their Google Business Profile had outdated opening hours and no photos. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages for routine care, surgery, dental and emergency services, sorted out the GBP with professional photos and proper categories, created content around common pet health topics and built links from veterinary directories. Over about seven months their new client registrations from organic search went from about three per week to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the veterinary content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't have experience writing.</p>

<p>The cafe and dining scene on Longueville Road has become more competitive as the population has grown. New cafes and restaurants are opening regularly. A hospitality business in Lane Cove that invests in local SEO and GBP management can build a strong online presence that captures the searches from new residents who are still discovering what the area has to offer.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Lane Cove businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For veterinary clinics and medical practices in Lane Cove its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Lane Cove business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Lane Cove area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
