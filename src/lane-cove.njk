<h2>Why Local SEO Matters in Lane Cove</h2>

<p>Lane Cove is a lower North Shore suburb within the 2066 postcode, centred on a village commercial precinct along Burns Bay Road and Longueville Road. The suburb sits between Chatswood to the north and the harbour suburbs of Greenwich and Longueville to the south, bordered by Lane Cove National Park to the west. The Lane Cove Plaza shopping centre and the surrounding village strip include supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, health practitioners, and retail stores serving the local residential catchment. Lane Cove has a family-oriented demographic, with established houses and newer apartment developments creating a mixed residential base.</p>

<p>The village character of Lane Cove creates a defined local search market. Residents tend to search for services within their immediate area, using "Lane Cove" as a location qualifier for trades, dining, health services, and retail. The commercial precinct on Burns Bay Road is walkable and self-contained, which means businesses with strong local search visibility capture a reliable share of the suburb's spending. For trades and home services, the established housing stock and the proximity to Lane Cove National Park generate consistent demand for property maintenance, gardening, pest control, and renovation services.</p>
