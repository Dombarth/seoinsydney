            <h2>The First Month: Audit and Strategy</h2>
            <p>Any good SEO engagement starts with understanding where you are. This typically includes:</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Audit</h3>
            <p>Checking your site for technical issues that affect search visibility. Site speed, mobile usability, crawl issues, indexation problems, schema markup, internal linking. This identifies quick fixes and foundational issues.</p>
            
            <h3>Content Review</h3>
            <p>Looking at what content you have, how it's structured, and what's missing. This includes keyword research to understand what your potential customers actually search for.</p>
            
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>Understanding who ranks for your target terms and why. This informs what you need to do to compete.</p>
            
            <h3>Strategy Development</h3>
            <p>Based on the audit, a plan for what to work on first. Not everything can be done at once. Good strategy prioritises what will have the most impact.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Implementation</h3>
            <p>Some technical fixes can start immediately. Quick wins get addressed while longer-term work is planned.</p>

<!-- Months Two and Three Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Months Two and Three: Building Momentum</h2>
            <p>After the initial audit, the work begins in earnest:</p>
            
            <h3>Content Development</h3>
            <p>Creating or improving pages based on the keyword research. Service pages, location pages, informational content. This is often the bulk of ongoing SEO work.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Improvements</h3>
            <p>Continuing to fix issues identified in the audit. Some technical work is quick, some requires developer time or server changes.</p>
            
            <h3>Link Building</h3>
            <p>Beginning outreach for links from other websites. This is slow work. Quality links take time to earn.</p>
            
            <h3>Local SEO</h3>
            <p>For local businesses, optimising Google Business Profile, building local citations, and managing reviews.</p>
            
            <h3>Early Signs of Progress</h3>
            <p>You might start seeing improved rankings for low-competition terms. More impressions in Google Search Console. Slight traffic increases. These are early indicators that things are moving in the right direction.</p>

<!-- Months Three to Six Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Months Three to Six: Results Emerge</h2>
            <p>This is when meaningful results typically start showing:</p>
            
            <h3>Ranking Improvements</h3>
            <p>Target keywords start moving up. Maybe not page one yet, but visible progress. More keywords start appearing in the top 100, then top 50, then top 20.</p>
            
            <h3>Traffic Growth</h3>
            <p>Organic traffic increases. Not just from rankings, but from more pages being indexed and appearing for more searches.</p>
            
            <h3>Lead Increases</h3>
            <p>More enquiries start coming in. The connection between SEO work and business results becomes visible.</p>
            
            <h3>What's Still Being Done</h3>
            <p>Content continues to be created or improved. Link building continues. Technical maintenance. SEO is not a one-time fix, it's ongoing work.</p>

<!-- What Results Look Like Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Results Actually Look Like</h2>
            <p>SEO results aren't a single moment where everything changes. They're gradual improvements that compound:</p>
            
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>More keywords ranking:</strong> Your site appears for more searches than before</li>
                <li><strong>Higher positions:</strong> Keywords that were on page 3 move to page 2, then page 1</li>
                <li><strong>More traffic:</strong> Steady increase in visitors from search</li>
                <li><strong>Better quality traffic:</strong> Visitors who are actually looking for what you offer</li>
                <li><strong>More enquiries:</strong> Contact form submissions, phone calls, bookings</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The exact results depend on your starting point, competition, and the work being done. A site with major technical issues might see dramatic improvements from fixes alone. A site that's already well-optimised might see slower incremental gains.</p>

<!-- What You Should Receive Section -->

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What You Should Receive</h2>
            
            <h3>Clear Communication</h3>
            <p>You should understand what's being done and why. If you don't, ask. Good SEO providers explain their work in terms you can understand.</p>
            
            <h3>Regular Reporting</h3>
            <p>Monthly reports showing rankings, traffic, and conversions. The reports should connect to business outcomes, not just vanity metrics.</p>
            
            <h3>Access to Your Data</h3>
            <p>You should have access to Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and any other tools being used to track your performance. It's your data.</p>
            
            <h3>Honest Updates</h3>
            <p>If something isn't working, you should be told. If goals need to be adjusted, that conversation should happen. SEO doesn't always go according to plan, and honest communication about challenges is essential.</p>

            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Guaranteed rankings:</strong> No one can guarantee specific positions in search results</li>
                <li><strong>Instant results:</strong> SEO takes time. Anyone promising otherwise is either lying or using risky tactics</li>
                <li><strong>Fix a bad business:</strong> SEO brings visitors. If your product, service, or website doesn't convert them, SEO won't help</li>
                <li><strong>Replace other marketing:</strong> SEO works best as part of a broader marketing approach</li>
                <li><strong>Work without investment:</strong> Real SEO requires real work. Cheap SEO is usually ineffective or harmful</li>
