suburbContext: |
    <p>Marrickville is an inner-west suburb experiencing significant transformation. Former industrial spaces are being converted to breweries, creative studios, and modern hospitality venues while maintaining a multicultural retail presence.</p>
    <p>The business profile includes breweries and distilleries, creative industries, manufacturing, wholesale, hospitality, and diverse retail serving the local multicultural community.</p>
    <p>Marrickville's relatively affordable commercial rents (compared to neighbouring suburbs) have attracted startups, makers, and creative businesses.</p>
competitionSection: |
    <p>Marrickville's evolving business landscape creates varied competitive dynamics. Established industrial and wholesale businesses have different SEO needs than newer hospitality and creative ventures.</p>
    <p>The craft brewery and distillery concentration creates competition for "brewery" and "craft beer" searches in the Inner West and Sydney-wide.</p>
    <p>Local service businesses benefit from the growing residential population, with relatively lower competition than more established inner-city retail strips.</p>
