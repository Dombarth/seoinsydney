<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation services for businesses in Marrickville and the surrounding inner west. Marrickville has changed a lot over the past decade. The area around Illawarra Road and Marrickville Road still has the traditional mix of Vietnamese and Greek restaurants, butchers and local shops but the industrial areas have been filling up with breweries, creative studios, fitness gyms and specialty food producers.</p>

<h2>Two Different Types of Businesses in Marrickville</h2>

<p>Its an interesting market because you've got two very different types of businesses. The traditional retail and food businesses on the main strips have been here for decades and mostly rely on their existing customer base. Then you've got the newer businesses in the converted warehouses and industrial spaces that need to attract customers from across Sydney because people don't just stumble past them.</p>

<h2>Craft Brewery on Sydenham Road</h2>

<p>We started working with a craft brewery on Sydenham Road in late 2022. They'd been open about eighteen months and had built a following through Instagram and markets but their website was basically a landing page with their address on it. They weren't showing up in Google for anything. No brewery searches, no bar searches, no venue hire searches. We built out a proper site with pages for their taproom, events space and online shop, optimised the Google Business Profile and built links from beer blogs and local hospitality directories. Within about eight months they were getting consistent organic traffic and their venue hire enquiries went from about two a month to eight or ten.</p>

<h2>Trades Businesses Based in Marrickville</h2>

<p>For the trades businesses that are based in Marrickville's industrial areas the SEO challenge is usually about ranking for service terms across the inner west and wider Sydney. Plumbers, electricians, cabinet makers, signwriters. These businesses don't need local Marrickville customers specifically, they need to rank for their service across a wider area.</p>

<h2>Pricing and How We Work</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with full breakdown before we start. No setup fees and no lock in contracts. Month to month, 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All work is done by our local team. We don't outsource anything offshore and each specialist handles no more than fifteen accounts.</p>
