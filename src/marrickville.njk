  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For trades businesses, hospitality venues, or health practices in competitive categories, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level, keyword scope, and technical requirements. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2204 postcode has moderate competition for most service categories. Trades and hospitality businesses with well-optimised Google Business Profiles can see faster initial results. For businesses in more competitive categories, six months is a realistic timeline for consistent organic visibility."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner west including Newtown, Enmore, Dulwich Hill, Sydenham, Tempe, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the search landscape and industry of each business."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area sits in the heart of Sydney's inner west within the 2204 postcode. The suburb is bounded by the Illawarra railway line, with the main road and Illawarra Road serving as the main commercial corridors. The area borders Newtown, Enmore, Dulwich Hill, Sydenham, and Tempe. The area has undergone significant demographic change over the past decade, transitioning from a traditional working-class suburb with a strong Vietnamese, Greek, and Portuguese community into one of Sydney's most active hospitality, brewing, and creative industry precincts. The industrial areas around Smidmore Street and Sydenham Road now house breweries, distilleries, art studios, and food production businesses.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate, with the strongest competition in hospitality and food-related searches. Many trades businesses, health practitioners, and professional services in the area have not invested in SEO, which creates clear opportunity for those that do. The suburb's growing reputation as a dining and nightlife destination means search volume for the area-specific queries continues to increase.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>The hospitality and food production sector drives the highest search volume growth here. The brewery and distillery precinct around Smidmore Street, Sydenham Road, and the industrial areas has created a distinct category of search demand that did not exist five years ago. For these businesses, Google Business Profile visibility, review management, and event-related content are the primary drivers of foot traffic and bookings.</p>

<p>Trades businesses here serve the dense residential area across the inner west. Plumbers, electricians, builders, and renovation specialists compete for near me searches and suburb-specific trade queries. The growing number of terrace house and apartment renovations in the area generates consistent demand for trades searches. For these businesses, a well-optimised Google Business Profile with genuine reviews and accurate service area information is the most effective starting point.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
