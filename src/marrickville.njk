<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Marrickville and across the inner west. We've been working with businesses around Marrickville Road, Illawarra Road, Sydenham Road and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Marrickville has changed a lot in recent years with the warehouse conversions and the craft brewery scene bringing in a different crowd.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Marrickville has a strong mix of light industrial businesses, food manufacturers, breweries, creative studios, auto mechanics and an increasingly diverse hospitality scene. The Vietnamese restaurant strip along Marrickville Road is well established and competitive. For businesses in Marrickville the SEO opportunity is often in the trade and service categories where theres strong search volume but relatively few businesses have invested in any online visibility at all. Its a suburb where basic local SEO can move the needle quickly.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with an auto electrical shop on Sydenham Road in mid 2021 that had been operating for about fifteen years. Father and son business, excellent reputation locally but all their work came through repeat customers and referrals from mechanics which is where most of their leads had always come from. Their website was a free Wix page with a phone number and an address. We built a proper site with service pages for each type of work they do, sorted out the Google Business Profile with correct categories and photos, and built citations across automotive directories. Over about six months their new customer enquiries went from maybe two a week to about eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the content for specialist trade services which a lot of other agencies don't really understand.</p>

<p>The brewery and bar scene in Marrickville is growing fast. Theres about a dozen breweries and taprooms in the industrial area south of Marrickville Road and the competition for brewery related searches is increasing. Most of them rely on social media and events for foot traffic. A Marrickville brewery that invests in local SEO and manages its GBP properly can capture a lot of the weekend planning searches that people do when looking for something to do in the inner west.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Marrickville businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For trade and industrial businesses in Marrickville its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services and areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Marrickville business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Marrickville area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
