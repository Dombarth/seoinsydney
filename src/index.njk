            <p>Every client gets a monthly report that shows exactly what work was carried out. Not a dashboard with traffic graphs and no context. An actual written report covering keyword research, on page changes, link building, content work and technical SEO. The team at SEO In Sydney break down how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were.</p>
            <p>If your organic traffic went up we tell you why. If it didn't we tell you that as well.</p>
            <p>We handle on page SEO, technical SEO, content creation, link building, Google Business Profile optimisation, citation management and monthly reporting. Same tools as everyone else. Google Search Console, Ahrefs, Semrush, Screaming Frog. We don't have proprietary AI technology.</p>

            <h2>The Sydney Market</h2>
            <p>Sydney is a big market and every suburb has its own competitive dynamics. A dentist in Bondi Junction is fighting 25 other practices within a few kilometres for three map positions. An accountant in Parramatta is competing against firms that have been investing in SEO for three or four years already. A tradie in the inner west needs to show up for "near me" searches and half the time they don't even have a Google Business Profile set up properly.</p>
            <p>We took on a plumbing company in the inner west in early 2022 that had been paying another agency $2,000 a month for about eighteen months with nothing to show for it. Their website had about 40 spammy backlinks from offshore directories, the Google Business Profile was using the wrong categories and the site itself was a five page WordPress template with no service pages. We cleaned up the backlink profile, rebuilt the site with proper service pages and location content, and fixed the GBP. About eight months in they were getting 30 to 40 organic enquiries a month. They're still with us.</p>

            <p>Month to month. 30 days notice. No lock in contracts of any kind. Over 90% of our clients stay with us long term without a contract which says more than any sales pitch.</p>
            <p>If you stop, everything stays yours. Content we've written stays on your website. Technical improvements stay in place. Backlinks we've built don't get removed. We don't hold anything hostage.</p>
            <p>Each of our specialists manages no more than fifteen accounts at a time. At larger agencies its common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. We keep our numbers manageable so every account gets the time it needs.</p>
            <p>All work is done by our Sydney based team. We don't send work offshore. I review every strategy personally.</p>
