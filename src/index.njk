<!-- How SEO Works in Sydney -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How SEO Works in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney is a competitive search market and every suburb has different dynamics. A dentist in Bondi Junction competes against twenty-five practices within a few kilometres for three map pack positions. An accountant in Parramatta faces firms that have been investing in search engine optimisation for three or four years. A tradie in the inner west needs to rank for near me searches and often does not have a Google Business Profile configured correctly.</p>
            <p>The pattern I see most often with Sydney businesses is one of two situations. Either they have done nothing with SEO, or they have been with an agency that outsources content offshore and buys links from private blog networks. The monthly reports look impressive with traffic graphs and keyword charts but when you examine the data closely there are no actual leads or phone calls coming through.</p>
            <p>Every campaign I run is built around what the business actually needs. That starts with a technical audit of the website, competitor analysis for your specific industry and area, and then a clear plan with measurable targets.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Website and Technical SEO -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Website and Technical SEO</h2>
            <p>Most SEO problems start with the website itself. Before any links are built or content written, I audit what is happening under the hood.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Site speed and Core Web Vitals:</strong> Slow pages lose rankings and visitors. I audit LCP, INP, and CLS metrics and fix what is slowing your site down.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile usability:</strong> The majority of searches in Sydney happen on mobile devices. Your website needs to function properly on phones, not just look acceptable.</li>
                <li><strong>Crawlability and indexation:</strong> If Google cannot crawl and index your pages correctly then nothing else matters. I check for indexation issues, redirect chains, broken links, duplicate content, and orphan pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Schema markup:</strong> Structured data helps search engines understand what your business does, where you operate, and what services you offer. I implement LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, and other relevant schema types.</li>
                <li><strong>Backlink profile audit:</strong> If you have had previous SEO work done, I audit your backlink profile first. Toxic links from a previous agency can actively suppress your rankings and need to be cleaned up before building anything new.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The technical foundation has to be right. Organic rankings, local search visibility, and AI search selection all depend on it.</p>
        </div>

<!-- AEO and GEO -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>AEO and GEO: AI Search Visibility</h2>
            <p>Search is changing. Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity are changing how people find and evaluate businesses. I make sure your business appears in AI-generated answers and recommendations, not just traditional search results.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/aeo/">Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)</a></strong> focuses on structuring your content so search engines can extract and display it directly in featured snippets, answer boxes, and AI Overviews. When someone searches a question relevant to your business, AEO determines whether your content appears as the answer.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/geo/">Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)</a></strong> focuses on being referenced by AI systems that synthesise answers from multiple sources. When someone asks ChatGPT or Gemini to recommend an SEO consultant in Sydney or a plumber in Parramatta, GEO determines whether your business gets mentioned.</p>
            <p>Both disciplines build on traditional SEO foundations. Clear, accurate, well-structured content from a credible source is what AI systems select. I integrate AEO and GEO into every campaign because this is where search is heading and early movers have a significant advantage.</p>

            <h2>Free SEO Audit</h2>
            <p>I will do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlink profile, and how you compare against your main competitors for the keywords that matter to your business. It is a written report, not a sales pitch. I send it through and you can decide from there whether it makes sense to have a conversation.</p>
            <p>I answer my phone. I am punctual with deadlines. I fix what I say I will fix. These sound like basic things but they are not common in the Sydney SEO industry.</p>
