            <p>We are not the biggest SEO agency and we don't claim to be. What we do offer is a straightforward approach to search engine optimisation where you actually know what you're paying for each month.</p>
            <p>Every client receives a monthly report that breaks down exactly what work was carried out including keyword research, on page optimisation, link building, content writing and technical SEO. The report includes how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were.</p>
            <p>We don't believe in sending through a generic PDF with traffic graphs and no context. If your organic traffic went up we will tell you why. If it didn't we will tell you that as well.</p>

            <h2>No Lock In Contracts</h2>
            <p>One of the most common things we hear from new clients is that they've been burned by a previous SEO agency. They were locked into a 12 month contract, they never really understood what was being done to their website and when they left nothing had changed.</p>
            <p>We do not offer lock in contracts of any kind. Our terms are month to month with 30 days notice. We stay because of results not because of a contract.</p>

            <h2>SEO Audit and Backlink Cleanup</h2>
            <p>Before we begin any SEO campaign we carry out a full SEO audit of your website which includes a technical audit, backlink audit, on page review and keyword research.</p>
            <p>This is especially important if you've had previous SEO work done because in many cases we find low quality backlinks, spammy directory listings and in some cases actual Google penalties that the previous agency never disclosed. We clean all of that up before we start any new work. There is no point building on a bad foundation.</p>
            <p>We offer a free SEO audit for new clients so you can see exactly where your website stands before making any commitment.</p>

            <h2>In House SEO Team</h2>
            <p>All SEO work is carried out in house by our local team. We do not outsource content writing, link building or technical SEO work offshore which is something that a large number of agencies do regardless of what their website says.</p>
            <p>When you call us you speak to the same person who is actually working on your account.</p>
            <p>Each SEO specialist in our team manages no more than fifteen accounts at any given time. At larger agencies it's common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. We keep our client numbers manageable so that every account gets the attention it needs.</p>

            <h2>Keywords That Actually Generate Business</h2>
            <p>Our SEO specialists focus on buyer intent keywords not vanity metrics. There is a big difference between ranking for a keyword that gets 10,000 searches a month and ranking for a keyword that actually leads to a phone call or a sale.</p>
            <p>A lot of agencies will show you Google rankings for broad informational terms that look impressive in a report but don't generate any actual business. We focus on commercial intent keywords and local search terms that bring in customers who are ready to buy or make an enquiry.</p>
            <p>We track conversions through to actual leads using call tracking and form tracking so that you can see exactly how many enquiries came from organic search each month. Not just how much traffic you got.</p>
