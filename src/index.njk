                <p class="hero-subtitle">Need SEO help in Sydney?</p>
                <p>I am Dom. 12 years experience doing SEO for Sydney businesses. I am familiar with every issue there is when it comes to ranking websites in this market and know the solution for each. From law firms in the CBD to tradies in Western Sydney to ecommerce stores selling nationally.</p>
                <p>If you are going to invest in SEO then I believe the most important part is knowing exactly who is doing the work on your website. Instead of using agencies that outsource everything offshore or hand you off to a junior account manager, I do the work myself and you deal with me directly.</p>

<!-- How SEO Works in Sydney -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How SEO Works in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney is a competitive market and every suburb has its own dynamics when it comes to search. A dentist in Bondi Junction is fighting 25 other practices within a few kilometres for three map positions. An accountant in Parramatta is competing against firms that have been investing in SEO for three or four years already. A tradie in the inner west needs to show up for near me searches and half the time they dont even have a Google Business Profile set up properly.</p>
            <p>There is a pattern I see over and over with Sydney businesses. They have either done nothing or they have been with an agency that sends offshore content and buys links from private blog networks. The monthly reports look impressive with traffic graphs and keyword charts but when you dig into the numbers there are no actual leads or sales coming through.</p>
            <p>I have worked across most industries and most areas in Sydney. The approach is always built around what the business actually needs rather than a template.</p>

<!-- Website and Technical SEO -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Website and Technical SEO</h2>
            <p>A lot of SEO problems start with the website itself. Before I build any links or write any content I look at what is happening under the hood.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Site speed:</strong> Slow pages lose rankings and visitors. I audit Core Web Vitals and fix what is slowing your site down.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Most searches in Sydney happen on phones. Your site needs to work properly on mobile, not just look OK.</li>
                <li><strong>Crawlability:</strong> If Google cannot crawl and index your pages properly then nothing else matters. I check for indexation issues, redirect chains, broken links and duplicate content.</li>
                <li><strong>Schema markup:</strong> Structured data helps search engines understand what your business does and where you operate. I implement LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ and other relevant schema types.</li>
                <li><strong>Backlink health:</strong> If you have had previous SEO work done I audit your backlink profile first. Toxic links from a previous agency can suppress your rankings and need to be cleaned up before building anything new.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The technical foundation has to be right. Everything else builds on top of it.</p>
        </div>

<!-- AEO and GEO -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>AEO and GEO: AI Search Visibility</h2>
            <p>Search is changing. ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and Google AI overviews are changing how people find businesses. I make sure your business shows up in AI generated answers, not just traditional Google results.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/aeo">Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)</a></strong> focuses on getting your content selected for featured snippets, answer boxes and direct answers in search results. This means structuring content so search engines can extract and display it when someone asks a relevant question.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/geo">Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)</a></strong> focuses on being referenced by AI systems that synthesise answers from multiple sources. When someone asks an AI tool to recommend an SEO agency in Sydney or a plumber in Parramatta, GEO is what determines whether your business gets mentioned.</p>
            <p>Both disciplines build on traditional SEO foundations. Clear, accurate, well-structured content from a credible source is what AI systems look for. I integrate AEO and GEO into every campaign because this is where search is heading.</p>

            <h2>Free Audit</h2>
            <p>I will do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors. It is a written report not a sales pitch. I send it through and you can decide from there whether it is worth having a conversation about what I can do.</p>
            <p>I am punctual with deadlines. I answer my calls. I fix issues. It may sound like basic things but they are not typical in the Sydney SEO industry.</p>
