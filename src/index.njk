                <p class="hero-subtitle">Need SEO help in Sydney?</p>
                <p>I am Dom. 12 years experience doing SEO for Sydney businesses. I am familiar with every issue there is when it comes to ranking websites in this market and know the solution for each. From law firms in the CBD to tradies in Western Sydney to ecommerce stores selling nationally.</p>
                <p>If you are going to invest in SEO then I believe the most important part is knowing exactly who is doing the work on your website. Instead of using agencies that outsource everything offshore or hand you off to a junior account manager, I do the work myself and you deal with me directly.</p>
                <p><strong>I rank others, I can rank you too.</strong></p>

<!-- Why Most SEO Campaigns Fail -->
<section class="content-section" id="why-seo-fails">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Most SEO Campaigns Fail in Sydney</h2>
            <p>There is a pattern I see over and over with Sydney businesses. They have either done nothing or they have been with an agency that sends offshore content and buys links from private blog networks. The monthly reports look impressive with traffic graphs and keyword charts but when you dig into the numbers there are no actual leads or sales coming through.</p>
            <p>I took on a plumbing company in the inner west in early 2022 that had been paying another agency $2,000 a month for about eighteen months with nothing to show for it. Their website had about 40 spammy backlinks from offshore directories, the Google Business Profile was using the wrong categories and the site itself was a five page WordPress template with no service pages.</p>
            <p>I cleaned up the backlink profile, rebuilt the site with proper service and location pages, sorted out the GBP and built links from trade directories and local business associations. About eight months in they were getting 30 to 40 organic enquiries a month which is where most of their new work now comes from. They are still with me three years later.</p>
            <p>The cleanup work is sometimes as important as the new optimisation. I do a backlink audit before I start any campaign and if there is toxic links I deal with those first before building anything new.</p>

<!-- Sydney Is Competitive -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Sydney Is Competitive</h2>
            <p>Sydney is a competitive market and every suburb has its own dynamics when it comes to search. A dentist in Bondi Junction is fighting 25 other practices within a few kilometres for three map positions. An accountant in Parramatta is competing against firms that have been investing in SEO for three or four years already. A tradie in the inner west needs to show up for near me searches and half the time they dont even have a Google Business Profile set up properly.</p>
            <p>I have worked across most of these industries and most of these areas. The approach is always built around what the business actually needs rather than a template. Its as simple as that.</p>
        </div>

<!-- What Makes Me Different -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Makes Me Different</h2>
            <p>Most SEO agencies in Sydney operate the same way. Sales person signs you up. Account manager sends you reports. Offshore team does the actual work. Nobody you talk to is the person doing your SEO.</p>
            <p>I work differently.</p>
            <p>You deal with me. I do the work. I write the reports. I answer the phone when you call. I manage no more than fifteen accounts at a time because I actually want to get results for each one rather than just collecting monthly fees.</p>
            <p>At larger agencies it is common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. That is not how you get results.</p>
            <p>All work is done by my Sydney based team. I dont send work offshore. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- What You Get Each Month -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg" id="what-you-get">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What You Get Each Month</h2>
            <p>All my reports cover exactly what work was carried out, with no hidden metrics or confusing dashboards. Not a dashboard with traffic graphs and no context. An actual written report covering keyword research, on page changes, link building, content work and technical SEO.</p>
            <p>I break down how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were. This is something a lot of agencies in this area dont bother doing.</p>
            <p>If your organic traffic went up I tell you why. If it didnt I tell you that as well.</p>
            <p>I handle on page SEO, technical SEO, content creation, link building, Google Business Profile optimisation, citation management and monthly reporting. Same tools as everyone else. Google Search Console, Ahrefs, Semrush, Screaming Frog. I dont have proprietary AI technology. I just do the work properly.</p>

<!-- Services Section -->
<section class="content-section" id="services">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Site speed, mobile, crawlability, indexation issues. The dull details that no one wants to hear but are there when you need them.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/local-seo">Local SEO</a>:</strong> Google Business Profile, maps, local search visibility. If you are going to rank in the map pack then I believe the most important part is getting your GBP set up correctly.</p>
            <p><strong>Content SEO:</strong> Content strategy, keyword targeting, service pages. I write content that ranks and converts.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="/aeo">AEO</a> and <a href="/geo">GEO</a>:</strong> AI search visibility, featured snippets, answer engines. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity are changing how people search. I make sure your business shows up in AI generated answers not just traditional Google results.</p>
            <p><strong>Link Building:</strong> High quality backlinks from real Australian websites. I dont use PBNs or offshore link farms that will get you penalised down the track.</p>

<!-- Different Businesses Need Different Approaches -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Different Businesses Need Different Approaches</h2>
            <p>For local service businesses across Sydney the Google Business Profile is usually the first priority. Map pack visibility drives more phone calls than organic results for most trades and local services.</p>
            <p>For ecommerce it is different. It is more about product page optimisation, category structure, site speed and building authority with relevant links.</p>
            <p>For professional services firms it is usually a combination of local SEO and content that positions them for the specific services they want to be known for.</p>
            <p>I handle all of these differently because they require different approaches and different timelines. I only take one client per industry in each area so I am never competing against myself.</p>
