            <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
            <p>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the practice of improving a website's visibility in organic search results. When people search for products, services, or information related to your business, SEO determines whether your website appears in those results.</p>
            <p>SEO involves three main areas: technical optimisation (how your website is built), content optimisation (what your website says), and authority building (how other websites reference yours). Each area contributes to search engines understanding your website and determining when to show it to searchers.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How SEO Works in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney's competitive business environment creates specific SEO considerations. The density of businesses in areas like the CBD, North Sydney, and Parramatta means search results are often crowded with competitors.</p>
            <p>Local search queries in Sydney frequently include suburb names or "near me" modifiers. This creates opportunities for businesses to target specific geographic areas rather than competing for broad terms across the entire metropolitan region.</p>
            <p>Sydney businesses also benefit from the city's economic diversity. Whether operating in professional services, retail, hospitality, or trades, there are established search patterns and user behaviours that inform effective SEO strategies.</p>

            <h2>Website and Technical SEO</h2>
            <p>Technical SEO forms the foundation of search visibility. Without proper technical implementation, content and links cannot perform effectively.</p>
            <p>Key technical factors include:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Page speed and Core Web Vitals performance</li>
                <li>Mobile responsiveness and usability</li>
                <li>Crawlability and indexation</li>
                <li>Site structure and internal linking</li>

                <li>HTTPS security and accessibility</li>

            <p>Many Sydney businesses operate websites built years ago that no longer meet modern technical requirements. Addressing these fundamentals often produces measurable improvements before any content work begins.</p>

            <h2>AEO and GEO: AI Search Optimisation</h2>
            <p>Search is evolving beyond traditional link listings. AI-powered search features like featured snippets, AI overviews, and conversational search assistants are changing how users find information.</p>
            <p><strong>Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)</strong> focuses on structuring content to appear in direct answer boxes and featured snippets. This requires clear question-and-answer formatting, concise definitions, and structured data markup.</p>
            <p><strong>Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)</strong> addresses how AI systems synthesise information from multiple sources. Content that is factually accurate, clearly attributed, and semantically complete is more likely to be referenced in AI-generated responses.</p>
            <p>Both AEO and GEO benefit from the same foundational principles: clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Content written for human understanding with proper structure tends to perform well across both traditional and AI search systems.</p>
