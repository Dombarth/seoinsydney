    <p>The business profile includes cafes, restaurants, bars, design agencies, tech startups, fashion retailers, and professional service firms. Many businesses in the area serve both local residents and visitors from across the city.</p>
    <p>The walkability and public transport access mean businesses often compete for customers who discover them through online search before visiting in person.</p>
