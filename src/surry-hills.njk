<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation and local SEO for businesses in Surry Hills and the surrounding inner city areas. Surry Hills has always been one of those suburbs where the business mix changes every couple of years and the SEO landscape shifts with it. Crown Street, Bourke Street and the blocks around Central Station have a completely different commercial profile to what they had five years ago.</p>

<p>The area is heavy on creative agencies, digital studios, cafes and small hospitality venues. Theres also a growing number of tech startups and co-working spaces especially around the Cleveland Street end. A lot of these businesses rely on foot traffic and word of mouth but when they start looking at where their online enquiries are coming from they realise they're invisible on Google.</p>

<p>We started working with a cafe on Crown Street in late 2021 that had been open for about three years. Great reviews on Google, loyal local following, but they weren't showing up in maps results for anything beyond their exact business name. The Google Business Profile categories were wrong, they had no website content beyond a single home page with a menu PDF, and there were about 15 duplicate or inconsistent directory listings floating around. We cleaned all of that up, built out a basic website with proper location content and optimised the GBP. Within about six months they were consistently in the top three map results for cafe related searches in the area.</p>

<p>For creative agencies and digital businesses in Surry Hills the competition is different. Its less about local map results and more about ranking for service terms like "branding agency Sydney" or "web design agency." These are competitive terms and the agencies that rank for them have usually been doing SEO for a while already.</p>

<p>We handle on page SEO, technical SEO, content creation, link building, Google Business Profile optimisation and monthly reporting. Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month with 30 days notice. No contracts. If you leave everything stays yours.</p>

<p>The team at SEO In Sydney are all based locally. We don't outsource anything offshore and each specialist handles no more than fifteen accounts.</p>
