faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues or professional services competing in the inner-city market, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,200. Pricing depends on competition level, the number of target keywords, and technical requirements. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2010 postcode is competitive due to the high concentration of creative agencies, hospitality venues, and professional services. Businesses in less saturated categories can see faster results, particularly through Google Business Profile optimisation."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Sydney including Darlinghurst, Paddington, Redfern, the CBD, and all suburbs in the metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours including content, backlinks, and technical improvements."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area sits immediately south of the Sydney CBD in the 2010 postcode. Crown Street serves as the main commercial strip, running from Oxford Street down to Cleveland Street, with a dense concentration of cafes, restaurants, bars, design studios, and creative agencies. The area borders Darlinghurst to the north, Redfern to the south, and Paddington to the east. The area has evolved from a historically working-class area into one of Sydney's most established creative and hospitality precincts.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate to high, driven by the number of hospitality venues and creative businesses in the area. For restaurants and cafes, Google Business Profile optimisation is often the most effective starting point. For professional services and creative agencies, organic search visibility builds a consistent source of enquiries from clients searching for services in the inner city.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive hospitality or professional services categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,200. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
