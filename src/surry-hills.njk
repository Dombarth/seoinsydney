<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Surry Hills and the surrounding areas. We've been working with businesses around Crown Street, Bourke Street, Cleveland Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Surry Hills has always been one of the more interesting suburbs to work in because of how diverse the business mix is.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Surry Hills has a strong concentration of creative agencies, tech startups, design studios, cafes and restaurants all packed into a relatively small area. Its one of the most digitally aware suburbs in Sydney which means the businesses here tend to already know what SEO is even if they haven't invested in it properly. The competition for food and hospitality searches in Surry Hills is intense. Theres dozens of cafes and restaurants along Crown Street alone and most of them rely on Instagram rather than organic search.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a boutique digital design studio on Bourke Street in mid 2019 that had been running for about six years. Three designers, a project manager and a solid portfolio of work. They had a beautiful website but it was built entirely in JavaScript with almost no crawlable content and their organic traffic was basically zero which is where most of their problems came from. Over about eight months we rebuilt the site structure, added case study pages and service pages with proper content, sorted out the technical SEO and built links from design directories and industry blogs. The team at SEO In Sydney handle that entire process in house including the copy and link outreach which a lot of other agencies in Surry Hills outsource overseas.</p>

<p>The fitness and wellness industry in Surry Hills is another category thats growing fast. Yoga studios, pilates reformer studios, personal training gyms and wellness centres are all competing for the same local searches. Most of them have basic one page websites and haven't touched their Google Business Profile. For businesses in Surry Hills even a modest investment in local SEO can shift things noticeably because theres a big gap between businesses that have done the work and those that haven't.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Surry Hills businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For more competitive categories like design agencies or hospitality in Surry Hills its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how broad the targeting is. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Surry Hills business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Surry Hills area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
