  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Surry Hills business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Surry Hills businesses start from $1,200 per month. For more competitive categories like design agencies or hospitality venues, it typically sits between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how broad the targeting is. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts."
  - q: "Is SEO worth it for a cafe or restaurant in Surry Hills?"
    a: "For hospitality venues in Surry Hills, local SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation can make a noticeable difference. Most cafes and restaurants in the area rely on Instagram rather than organic search, which means even basic local SEO work creates separation from competitors who have not invested in it."
  - q: "What industries do you work with in Surry Hills?"
    a: "We work with creative agencies, design studios, tech startups, cafes, restaurants, fitness studios, wellness centres and professional services firms in Surry Hills. Each business type has different search patterns and competition levels."
  - q: "How long until I see results?"
    a: "Most Surry Hills businesses start seeing measurable movement within three to five months. Competitive categories like design agencies may take longer. Hospitality businesses often see faster results because the competition for local search is wide but shallow."

<p>We provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Surry Hills and the surrounding areas. We have been working with businesses around Crown Street, Bourke Street, Cleveland Street and the surrounding blocks since 2015. Surry Hills has always been one of the more interesting suburbs to work in because of how diverse the business mix is.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock-in contracts and local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is handled in-house by our Sydney-based team.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape in Surry Hills</h2>

<p>Surry Hills has a strong concentration of creative agencies, tech startups, design studios, cafes and restaurants packed into a relatively small area. It is one of the most digitally aware suburbs in Sydney, which means the businesses here tend to already understand what SEO is even if they have not invested in it properly.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Surry Hills:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High density of creative and tech businesses competing for overlapping terms</li>
    <li>Intense hospitality competition along Crown Street and surrounding blocks</li>
    <li>Most cafes and restaurants rely on social media rather than organic search</li>
    <li>Growing fitness and wellness sector with basic web presence gaps</li>
    <li>Digitally aware business owners who understand search but have not prioritised it</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Surry Hills</h2>

<p>We started working with a boutique digital design studio on Bourke Street in mid-2019 that had been running for about six years. Three designers, a project manager and a solid portfolio. They had a well-designed website but it was built entirely in JavaScript with almost no crawlable content, and their organic traffic was close to zero.</p>

<p>Over about eight months we rebuilt the site structure, added case study pages and service pages with proper content, sorted out the technical SEO and built links from design directories and industry publications. The entire process was handled in-house including the copy and link outreach.</p>

<p>The fitness and wellness industry in Surry Hills is another category that continues to grow. Yoga studios, pilates reformer studios, personal training gyms and wellness centres are all competing for the same local searches. Most have basic one-page websites and have not touched their Google Business Profile. Even a modest investment in local SEO can shift things noticeably because of the gap between businesses that have done the work and those that have not.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Technical SEO audits and fixes</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service and portfolio pages</li>
    <li>Content strategy and production</li>
    <li>Link building from industry-relevant sources</li>
    <li>Citation management</li>
    <li>Monthly reporting with clear metrics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Surry Hills businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building and monthly reporting. For more competitive categories like design agencies or hospitality venues, it usually sits between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how broad the targeting is. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave, everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. Each specialist handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We will do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in Surry Hills. It is a written report, not a sales pitch.</p>
