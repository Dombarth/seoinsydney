<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Randwick and along the Belmore Road and Avoca Street commercial areas. Randwick has a unique mix of industries because of the hospital, the university and the racecourse. That creates demand across healthcare, student services, hospitality and professional services that you don't see in the same combination anywhere else in the eastern suburbs.</p>

<p>The medical and allied health market around the Prince of Wales Hospital and Royal Randwick is one of the most competitive in Sydney. Theres a concentration of specialists, physiotherapists, dentists and allied health practices all within a few blocks of each other. Most of them rely on GP referrals and have never invested in search visibility. The ones that have are getting a disproportionate share of new patient enquiries.</p>

<p>We started working with a physiotherapy practice near the hospital in late 2019. They had three practitioners and a basic website that hadn't been updated in years. They were getting almost all their patients from GP referrals and hospital overflow. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and treatment pages, optimised their GBP, fixed listing inconsistencies across about 30 health directories and built links from physiotherapy associations and local health networks. Within about nine months they were ranking for physio related searches across Randwick, Coogee, Kensington and Maroubra. Their new patient enquiries from search went from almost none to about twelve per month. They've since added a fourth practitioner partly based on the increased patient volume.</p>

<p>The other side of Randwick around Belmore Road is more retail and hospitality focused. Cafes, restaurants, beauty salons, a few boutique shops. These businesses tend to be competing for local foot traffic searches and the map pack is critical for them.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Medical and allied health is typically higher depending on the number of services and conditions being targeted. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
