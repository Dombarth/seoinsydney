<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Randwick and across the southeastern suburbs. We've been working with businesses along Belmore Road, Avoca Street, Alison Road and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Randwick has become more accessible with the light rail connecting it directly to the city which has changed the dynamics for local businesses.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Randwick has a strong mix of medical and health services clustered around the Prince of Wales Hospital and UNSW precinct, along with a busy commercial strip on Belmore Road with cafes, restaurants, retail and professional services. For businesses in Randwick the proximity to the hospital and university creates a unique search environment. Theres a lot of health related search volume and student facing services competing for attention. Its a suburb where medical practices and allied health providers can benefit significantly from local SEO because the search intent is very specific and commercial.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an optometry practice near Belmore Road in early 2022 that had been operating for about seven years. Two optometrists and a retail dispensing area. They had a solid repeat customer base but weren't attracting enough new patients which is where most of their growth concerns came from. Their website was a template from their frame supplier with no local content and their Google Business Profile was missing key services like contact lens fitting and paediatric eye care. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages, created content around common vision conditions, sorted out the GBP with proper categories and photos and built links from optometry directories and health publications. Over about six months their new patient bookings from organic search went from about three per week to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the eye care content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The restaurant and cafe scene on Belmore Road is competitive but most of the hospitality businesses in Randwick still haven't invested in proper local SEO. A restaurant in Randwick that manages its GBP well and ranks for dining searches can stand out quickly because the competition online is much weaker than the actual foot traffic competition on the strip.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Randwick businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical and allied health practices in Randwick its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how many services and conditions are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Randwick business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Randwick area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
