  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For health practitioners near the Prince of Wales Hospital or hospitality venues on Belmore Road, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2031 postcode has moderate competition for most service categories, with higher competition in health and medical services due to the hospital precinct. Businesses with well-optimised Google Business Profiles typically see faster initial improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the eastern suburbs including Coogee, Bondi Junction, Kensington, Kingsford, Maroubra, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a major eastern suburbs hub within the 2031 postcode, anchored by the Prince of Wales Hospital, the Royal Hospital for Women, and the Sydney Children's Hospital on the area Health Campus. The University of New South Wales (UNSW) sits on the suburb's western boundary, bringing a large student and academic population to the area. Belmore Road is the primary commercial strip, with cafes, restaurants, and retail serving local residents. The Royal the Racecourse is a significant local landmark and event venue. The suburb is served by the CBD and South East Light Rail, with stops at UNSW High Street and the area connecting directly to Circular Quay.</p>

<p>The combination of a major hospital precinct, a university, and established residential areas creates a diverse and consistent search demand profile here. Health practitioners benefit from the hospital association and the concentration of medical services in the area, but competition for health-related search terms is also higher. For hospitality businesses on Belmore Road, retail operators, and trades serving the residential population, local SEO captures enquiries from a suburb with high foot traffic and a strong local identity.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For health practitioners and professional services in the hospital precinct area, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
