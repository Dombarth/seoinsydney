<h2>The Search Landscape in Randwick</h2>

<p>Randwick sits at the intersection of several search demand drivers. The university brings student and academic searches, the hospital creates medical and health search demand, and the residential population drives local service searches along Belmore Road and the surrounding streets.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Randwick:</p>

    <li>Medical specialists and allied health practitioners near the hospital precinct</li>
    <li>Student and education-adjacent businesses near UNSW</li>
    <li>Local hospitality and retail along Belmore Road</li>

<h2>How We Work in Randwick</h2>

<p>We worked with an optometry practice near the Prince of Wales Hospital that had been operating for about nine years. They had two optometrists and a steady patient base but were not appearing in local search results. Their website was a basic template with minimal content and their Google Business Profile was set up under a generic category rather than the specific optometry category. Over about five months we restructured the site with individual service pages for each type of eye care, optimised the GBP with correct categories and service descriptions, and built citations across optical and health directories. They started ranking in the local map pack and receiving new patient bookings through search.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses along Belmore Road, the approach centres on Google Business Profile optimisation. The strip has a good density of cafes, restaurants and takeaway venues. Review management, photo quality and regular GBP activity are the primary levers for these businesses.</p>
