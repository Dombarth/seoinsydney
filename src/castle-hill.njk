<h2>How We Work in Castle Hill</h2>

<p>We worked with an accounting firm near Castle Towers that had been operating for about ten years. They served both business and personal clients across the Hills District but had minimal organic search presence. Over about six months we rebuilt their site with individual service pages, created content around the tax and accounting questions their clients were searching for, optimised the Google Business Profile and built citations across accounting directories. They started receiving a consistent flow of new client enquiries through search.</p>
