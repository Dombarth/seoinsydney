<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Castle Hill and across the Hills District. We've been working with businesses around Old Northern Road, Showground Road, Victoria Avenue, Castle Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Castle Hill has grown significantly with the metro line opening up and the ongoing commercial development around the town centre.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Castle Hill is the commercial centre of the Hills District with a large and affluent residential catchment. Theres a concentration of medical specialists, dental practices, real estate agencies, financial planners, legal firms and a strong retail precinct anchored by Castle Towers. For businesses in Castle Hill the market is growing as the metro brings more connectivity and new development increases the population. Its a suburb where the businesses that invest in SEO early are building positions that will be hard to displace as competition increases over the coming years.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an orthodontic practice near Victoria Avenue in mid 2021 that had been operating for about eight years. Two orthodontists specialising in braces and clear aligners. They were getting most of their patients from dental referrals which is where most of their consultations had always come from. Their website was a professional but content thin site with no treatment comparison pages and their Google Business Profile was missing several service categories. We rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages for traditional braces, ceramic braces, Invisalign and early intervention, created content around common orthodontic questions and built links from dental and orthodontic directories. Over about nine months their self referred consultation bookings went from about three per month to around twelve. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the orthodontic content which a lot of other agencies in the Hills District outsource to generic copywriters.</p>

<p>The dining and hospitality scene around Castle Hill has expanded with new restaurants and cafes opening to serve the growing population. Most rely on Castle Towers foot traffic and social media. A restaurant in Castle Hill that invests in local SEO and GBP management can capture the searches from the broader Hills District population who travel to Castle Hill for dining and entertainment.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Castle Hill businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical specialists and dental practices in Castle Hill its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many treatments and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Castle Hill clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Castle Hill strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Castle Hill area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
