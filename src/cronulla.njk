<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Cronulla and across the Sutherland Shire. Cronulla is the commercial and lifestyle heart of the Shire. The area along Cronulla Street, Kingsway and around the Cronulla Mall supports a strong mix of retail, hospitality, real estate, health services and professional services all serving a loyal and geographically contained local population.</p>

<p>The Sutherland Shire operates somewhat independently from the rest of Sydney when it comes to search behaviour. People in the Shire tend to search for and use local providers rather than looking towards the city or other parts of Sydney. This creates a distinct local search market where ranking well for Shire specific searches captures a dedicated customer base.</p>

<p>We started working with a real estate agency on Cronulla Street in late 2022. They had three agents and were well known locally but their digital presence wasn't matching their reputation. The website was outdated, the GBP had basic information and they weren't ranking for any property related searches in the Shire. We rebuilt the website with suburb profile pages for Cronulla, Caringbah, Miranda and surrounding areas, created content targeting vendor and landlord search intent and optimised the GBP. We built links from property portals and local community directories. Over about nine months they went from having minimal organic visibility to ranking for key real estate searches across the Sutherland Shire. Their vendor appraisal requests from organic search went from about one per month to roughly seven. The principal told us it was the most cost effective marketing they'd done.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses along Cronulla Street and the beachfront the market is seasonal and tourist influenced. Summer brings increased search traffic and competition. Businesses that maintain year round SEO consistency perform better than those that only think about it during peak season.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
