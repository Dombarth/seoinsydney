<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Cronulla and across the Sutherland Shire. We've been working with businesses around Cronulla Street, The Kingsway, Gerrale Street, Elouera Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Cronulla has maintained its position as the commercial and lifestyle centre of the Shire with a strong independent business community.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Cronulla is the main beachside commercial hub of the Sutherland Shire with a diverse mix of restaurants, cafes, bars, boutique retail, medical practices, real estate agencies and professional services firms. The Cronulla Mall and surrounding streets form a busy retail and dining precinct. For businesses in Cronulla the customer base extends well beyond the suburb itself because people travel from across the Shire for the beach, the dining and the services. Its a suburb where local SEO can deliver strong returns because the search catchment is much larger than the actual resident population.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a physiotherapy and sports medicine clinic near Cronulla Street in early 2022 that had been operating for about eight years. Three physiotherapists and a sports dietitian. They had a solid reputation with local athletes and surf club members but were losing new patient bookings to a newer clinic that had opened down the road which is where most of their competitive pressure came from. Their website was outdated and their Google Business Profile had incomplete service information. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and treatment pages, created content around surf injuries, running injuries and common sports conditions, sorted out the GBP and built links from physiotherapy associations and sports medicine directories. Over about seven months their new patient bookings from organic search went from about four per week to around eleven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the sports medicine content which a lot of other agencies in the Shire outsource.</p>

<p>The dining scene in Cronulla is competitive and seasonal. Summer brings a surge of visitors but the restaurants and cafes need consistent trade year round. A hospitality business in Cronulla that maintains strong local SEO and GBP management throughout the year can capture the planning searches from Shire residents who search for dining options before heading to the beach.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Cronulla businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical and allied health practices in Cronulla its usually between $1,400 and $2,000 depending on how many services and conditions are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Cronulla clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Cronulla strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Cronulla area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
