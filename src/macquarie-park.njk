<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Macquarie Park and the surrounding areas of North Ryde and Marsfield. Macquarie Park is one of Sydney's largest commercial and technology precincts. The area around Macquarie University, the Macquarie Centre and the technology corridor along Waterloo Road, Herring Road and Talavera Road houses major corporations, technology companies, pharmaceutical businesses and a growing number of smaller firms.</p>

<p>The technology and B2B services market in Macquarie Park is substantial. Companies here often target national or international audiences rather than local customers. Their SEO needs are different from a local business — they need to rank for industry specific terms, product categories and solution based searches rather than location based queries.</p>

<p>We started working with a managed IT services company in Macquarie Park in 2023. They had about 25 employees and served mid sized businesses across Sydney. Their website had been built by their internal development team and was technically sound but had almost no content strategy. They were relying entirely on referrals and partnerships for new clients. We built a comprehensive content strategy around their key service areas — managed IT support, cloud migration, cybersecurity, IT infrastructure — and created content targeting the problems their potential clients were searching for. We also optimised the technical SEO, built links from technology publications and business directories and created case study pages showcasing their work. Over about twelve months their organic traffic increased by roughly 200% and they were ranking for several competitive managed IT and cybersecurity search terms across Sydney. Their inbound client enquiries from organic search went from essentially zero to about four qualified leads per month which at their average contract value was a significant return.</p>

<p>For the retail and hospitality businesses around Macquarie Centre the local market is growing with new apartment developments bringing more residents to the area.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. National and B2B campaigns from $2,000. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
