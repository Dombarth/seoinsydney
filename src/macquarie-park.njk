<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Macquarie Park and across the northern districts. We've been working with businesses around Waterloo Road, Herring Road, Talavera Road, Lane Cove Road and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Macquarie Park has grown into one of Sydneys largest commercial and technology hubs with the university, the business park and the Macquarie Centre all driving activity in the area.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Macquarie Park is home to one of Australias biggest concentrations of technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, engineering companies and corporate offices. Theres also a growing residential population with new apartment developments around the metro stations. For businesses in Macquarie Park the market splits between corporate B2B services and the growing local consumer market. Its a suburb where technology and professional services companies can benefit from SEO by targeting specific industry searches while local service businesses can capture the residential population that is growing rapidly.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an IT managed services provider near Talavera Road in mid 2022 that had been operating for about five years. They serviced small to mid size businesses across Macquarie Park and the north shore. They were getting most of their clients from networking events and referrals which is where most of their contracts had always come from. Their website had basic service descriptions but no content targeting the specific IT problems their prospective clients were searching for. We rebuilt the site with individual service pages for managed IT, cybersecurity, cloud migration and IT support, created content around common IT challenges for SMEs, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from IT industry directories and business publications. Over about eight months their organic enquiries went from about one per month to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the technical IT content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The food and hospitality market around Macquarie Centre and the metro station precincts is growing. Restaurants and cafes serving the office worker population and the university students have a captive audience during business hours. A hospitality business in Macquarie Park that invests in local SEO can capture the lunch and dinner searches from a working population of over fifty thousand people.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Macquarie Park businesses start from $1,200 per month. For technology and professional services companies in Macquarie Park its usually between $1,500 and $2,500 depending on how many services and industries are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Macquarie Park business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Macquarie Park area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
