faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For technology companies and professional services in the business park, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2113 postcode has above-average competition for B2B and technology service categories due to the concentration of corporate offices. Niche technology and professional service keywords can see faster results."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner north including Ryde, Epping, Chatswood, North Ryde, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "The business park environment here means our clients are other businesses. B2B search is different and the campaign was structured accordingly. We now appear when procurement managers research services."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a major technology and corporate precinct within the 2113 postcode in Sydney's inner north. The local business corridor along Waterloo Road, Talavera Road, and Herring Road contains offices for major technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, financial services providers, and professional services businesses. Macquarie University anchors the precinct's western boundary, contributing academic, research, and student activity. Macquarie Centre is the main shopping destination, and the Sydney Metro Northwest line serves the area via the area and Macquarie University stations.</p>

<p>The corporate and technology concentration here creates a search landscape dominated by B2B and professional service queries. Many businesses in the precinct target a broader Sydney or national market rather than just the local geographic area. For these businesses, SEO strategy extends beyond local targeting to include industry-specific keywords, thought leadership content, and competitive authority building. The metro line has also increased the residential development in the area, creating new local search demand for everyday services, dining, and health practitioners that complement the corporate office demand.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For technology companies and professional services in competitive B2B categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
