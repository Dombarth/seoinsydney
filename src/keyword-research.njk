<!-- Why Keyword Research Matters -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Keyword Research Matters</h2>
            <p>Every SEO campaign depends on targeting the right keywords. Optimising for the wrong terms — keywords with no search volume, that do not match buyer intent, or that are too competitive for the current authority level — produces traffic that does not convert into business.</p>
            <p>Effective keyword research identifies the terms at the intersection of three factors:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Search volume:</strong> Enough people search for this term each month to make it worth targeting</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial intent:</strong> The people searching are likely to become customers, not just information seekers</li>
                <li><strong>Achievable difficulty:</strong> The competition is within reach given the website's current authority and resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keyword research is not a one-time activity. Search behaviour changes, new competitors enter the market, and business priorities evolve. I review and refine keyword targets throughout the campaign.</p>

<!-- Types of Keywords -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Types of Keywords</h2>
            <h3>Commercial Intent Keywords</h3>
            <p>Terms used by people ready to take action — make a purchase, request a quote, or contact a business. Examples: "plumber Parramatta," "SEO agency Sydney," or "accountant near me." These keywords have the highest conversion rates and are the primary focus of most campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Informational Keywords</h3>
            <p>Terms used by people seeking knowledge. Examples: "how to fix a leaking tap," "what is SEO," or "do I need an accountant." These keywords do not convert directly, but they build topical authority and attract potential customers early in their research.</p>

            <h3>Local Keywords</h3>
            <p>Terms with geographic modifiers — suburb names, "near me" variations, and city-specific terms. For businesses serving a specific area, local keywords are often the most valuable because they indicate both intent and proximity. <a href="/local-seo">Local SEO</a> strategies focus heavily on these terms.</p>

            <h3>Long-Tail Keywords</h3>
            <p>Longer, more specific search phrases. "Emergency electrician Bondi Junction open Saturday" is a long-tail keyword with very specific intent. These individually have lower search volume but collectively represent a significant portion of a website's organic traffic. They also tend to have higher conversion rates because the search intent is more specific.</p>

            <h3>Branded Keywords</h3>
            <p>Searches that include a business name or brand terms. Branded keywords indicate existing awareness and typically have very high conversion rates. Monitoring branded search performance tracks brand awareness growth over time.</p>

<!-- Process -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Keyword Research Process</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Business Understanding</h3>
            <p>Before looking at search data, I need to understand your business, your customers, and your competitive landscape. What services or products do you offer? What geographic areas do you serve? What does a valuable customer look like? This context ensures the keyword research aligns with actual business objectives.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Seed Keyword Discovery</h3>
            <p>I generate an initial list of seed keywords from multiple sources:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Your existing website content and analytics data</li>
                <li>Google Search Console data showing what queries already trigger your pages</li>
                <li>Competitor analysis — keywords your competitors rank for</li>
                <li>Industry terminology and common customer language</li>
                <li>Google's auto-suggest, "People Also Ask," and related searches</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>Each potential keyword is evaluated against:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Monthly search volume:</strong> How many times the keyword is searched per month in Australia</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword difficulty:</strong> How competitive the keyword is based on the authority of currently ranking pages</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-per-click data:</strong> The Google Ads CPC provides a proxy for commercial value</li>
                <li><strong>SERP features:</strong> What types of results appear and what this means for organic click potential</li>
                <li><strong>Current rankings:</strong> Whether you already rank for the keyword and at what position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Intent Classification</h3>
            <p>Every keyword is classified by intent:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Transactional:</strong> Ready to buy or enquire ("hire SEO agency")</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial investigation:</strong> Comparing options ("SEO agency reviews," "SEO cost Australia")</li>
                <li><strong>Informational:</strong> Seeking knowledge ("what is technical SEO")</li>
                <li><strong>Navigational:</strong> Looking for a specific website or brand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This classification determines which keywords are assigned to service pages (transactional), which to blog content (informational), and which are targeted through other means.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Prioritisation and Mapping</h3>
            <p>Keywords are prioritised into tiers based on their combined value (volume × intent × achievability) and mapped to specific pages. Each page targets a primary keyword and a cluster of related secondary keywords. This prevents keyword cannibalisation — multiple pages competing for the same term.</p>
