<!-- Why Keyword Research Matters -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Keyword Research Matters</h2>
            <p>Every SEO campaign depends on targeting the right keywords. If you optimise for the wrong terms — keywords that have no search volume, that do not match buyer intent, or that are too competitive for your current authority level — the campaign will produce traffic that does not convert into business.</p>
            <p>Effective keyword research identifies the terms that sit at the intersection of three factors:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Search volume:</strong> Enough people are searching for this term each month to make it worth targeting</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial intent:</strong> The people searching for this term are likely to become customers, not just information seekers</li>
                <li><strong>Achievable difficulty:</strong> The competition for this term is within reach given the website's current authority and resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keyword research is not a one-time activity. Search behaviour changes, new competitors enter the market, and business priorities evolve. We review and refine keyword targets throughout the campaign.</p>

<!-- Types of Keywords -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Types of Keywords</h2>
            <h3>Commercial Intent Keywords</h3>
            <p>These are the terms used by people who are ready to take action — make a purchase, request a quote, or contact a business. Examples include "plumber Parramatta," "SEO agency Sydney," or "accountant near me." These keywords have the highest conversion rates and are the primary focus of most SEO campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Informational Keywords</h3>
            <p>These are terms used by people seeking knowledge or solutions to problems. Examples include "how to fix a leaking tap," "what is SEO," or "do I need an accountant." While these keywords do not convert directly, they serve an important role in building topical authority and attracting potential customers early in their research process.</p>

            <h3>Local Keywords</h3>
            <p>These include geographic modifiers such as suburb names, "near me" variations, and city-specific terms. For businesses serving a specific area, local keywords are often the most valuable because they indicate both intent and proximity. <a href="/local-seo">Local SEO</a> strategies focus heavily on these terms.</p>

            <h3>Long-Tail Keywords</h3>
            <p>Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific search phrases. "Emergency electrician Bondi Junction open Saturday" is a long-tail keyword with very specific intent. These keywords individually have lower search volume but collectively can represent a significant portion of a website's organic traffic. They also tend to have higher conversion rates because the search intent is more specific.</p>

            <h3>Branded Keywords</h3>
            <p>These are searches that include your business name or brand terms. Branded keywords indicate existing awareness and typically have very high conversion rates. Monitoring branded search performance helps track brand awareness growth over time.</p>

<!-- Our Process -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Our Keyword Research Process</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Business Understanding</h3>
            <p>Before looking at search data, we need to understand your business, your customers, and your competitive landscape. What services or products do you offer? What geographic areas do you serve? What does a valuable customer look like? This context ensures the keyword research is aligned with actual business objectives.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Seed Keyword Discovery</h3>
            <p>We generate an initial list of seed keywords from multiple sources:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Your existing website content and analytics data</li>
                <li>Google Search Console data showing what queries already trigger your pages</li>
                <li>Competitor analysis — what keywords your competitors rank for</li>
                <li>Industry terminology and common customer language</li>
                <li>Google's auto-suggest, "People Also Ask," and related searches</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>Each potential keyword is evaluated against:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Monthly search volume:</strong> How many times the keyword is searched per month in Australia</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword difficulty:</strong> How competitive the keyword is based on the authority of currently ranking pages</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-per-click data:</strong> The Google Ads CPC provides a proxy for commercial value — keywords with high CPCs tend to be high-value</li>
                <li><strong>SERP features:</strong> What types of results appear (local pack, featured snippets, ads) and what this means for organic click potential</li>
                <li><strong>Current rankings:</strong> Whether you already rank for the keyword and at what position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Intent Classification</h3>
            <p>Every keyword is classified by intent:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Transactional:</strong> Ready to buy or enquire ("hire SEO agency")</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial investigation:</strong> Comparing options ("SEO agency reviews," "SEO cost Australia")</li>
                <li><strong>Informational:</strong> Seeking knowledge ("what is technical SEO")</li>
                <li><strong>Navigational:</strong> Looking for a specific website or brand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This classification determines which keywords are assigned to service pages (transactional), which to blog content (informational), and which are targeted through other means.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Prioritisation and Mapping</h3>
            <p>Keywords are prioritised into tiers based on their combined value (volume × intent × achievability) and mapped to specific pages on the website. Each page targets a primary keyword and a cluster of related secondary keywords. This prevents keyword cannibalisation — the problem of multiple pages competing for the same term.</p>
