            <h2>You Own Your Website</h2>
            <p>When I build your website you own it. You own the design files, the code, the content, the domain name and the hosting account. If you ever decide to move to another web designer or manage the site yourself you can do that at any time without paying a release fee.</p>
            <p>This is something worth asking any web design company upfront. I have seen cases where a business owner has paid thousands of dollars for a website only to find out that the agency owns the hosting, the domain or the CMS login and will not release them without an additional fee.</p>

            <p>All websites are built with on-page SEO as standard:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)</li>
                <li>Meta titles and descriptions for every page</li>

                <li>Mobile responsive design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console on every website so you can track how your site is performing from day one. If you need ongoing <a href="/">SEO services</a> I can help with that, but the SEO foundation is built into every website regardless.</p>

            <p>After that I offer monthly website management packages that include security updates, plugin updates, backups, content changes and technical support.
