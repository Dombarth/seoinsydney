Our team of web designers and developers have been building websites for Sydney businesses for over twelve years and we work across all major platforms including WordPress, Shopify, WooCommerce and custom built websites. We also provide logo design, branding and ongoing website support and maintenance.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Fixed Price Website Packages With No Hidden Costs</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest complaints we hear from new clients is that they contacted three or four web design agencies in Sydney before us and none of them had any pricing on their website. You had to fill out a form or book a call just to get a ballpark figure. We don't operate that way.</p>
            <p>Our website design packages start from $2,500 for a standard small business website and go up to $12,000 or more for custom ecommerce websites depending on the number of pages, functionality and design complexity.</p>
            <p>We provide a full written quote with an itemised breakdown before any work begins so there are no surprises at the end.</p>

<!-- You Own Your Website Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>You Own Your Website</h2>
            <p>This is something that most web design companies in Sydney will not tell you upfront but it's one of the most important things to ask.</p>
            <p>When we build your website you own it. You own the design files, the code, the content, the domain name and the hosting account. If you ever decide to move to another web designer or manage the site yourself you can do that at any time without paying a release fee or being held to ransom.</p>
            <p>We have seen too many cases where a business owner has paid thousands of dollars for a website only to find out that the web design agency owns the hosting, the domain or the CMS login and won't hand them over without an additional fee.</p>

<!-- Post Launch Support Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Happens After Your Website Goes Live</h2>
            <p>A lot of web design agencies in Sydney treat the project as finished once the website launches. You get your new website and then you never hear from them again. If something breaks or you need a change you either can't get hold of anyone or you get charged by the hour for every small update.</p>
            <p>We provide ongoing website support and maintenance as part of all our website design packages for the first 90 days after launch at no additional cost.</p>
            <p>After that we offer monthly website management packages that include security updates, plugin updates, backups, content changes and technical support. We also provide one on one training so you know how to make basic changes to your own website without needing to call a developer every time.</p>

            <h2>We Don't Use Templates and Pretend They're Custom</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of web design companies in Sydney that will charge you $5,000 or more for what is essentially a $60 WordPress theme with your logo dropped in and some content added. We don't do that.</p>
            <p>Every website we design is custom built from scratch based on your business, your brand and your target audience. We design in Figma first so you can see exactly what your website will look like across desktop, tablet and mobile before we write a single line of code.</p>
            <p>You get to approve the design before development begins and we include up to three rounds of revisions at each stage.</p>

            <h2>Websites That Actually Show Up On Google</h2>
            <p>Having a website that looks good but doesn't appear in Google search results is not much use to anyone. All of our websites are built with on page SEO as standard which includes:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Proper heading structure</li>
                <li>Meta titles and descriptions</li>
                <li>Image optimisation</li>
                <li>Schema markup and structured data</li>
                <li>Fast page load speeds</li>
                <li>Mobile responsive design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console on every website so you can track how your site is performing from day one. If you need ongoing <a href="/">SEO services</a> we can help with that as well but the SEO foundation is built into every website we create regardless.</p>

            <h2>Clear Timelines and Project Milestones</h2>
            <p>Another common frustration we hear from business owners is web design projects that drag on for months with no clear end date.</p>
            <p>Our standard small business websites are delivered within four to six weeks from the date we receive all content and assets. Ecommerce websites and custom development projects take six to twelve weeks depending on complexity.</p>
            <p>We provide a project timeline at the start with clear milestones for each stage including design sign off, development, content upload, testing and launch. You will have a dedicated project manager who is your single point of contact throughout.</p>

            <p>All website design and development work is carried out in house by our Sydney based team. We do not outsource design or development work offshore which is something that a large number of web design agencies in Sydney do regardless of what their website says.</p>
            <p>Some agencies maintain a small local team for client meetings and sales but send the actual design and coding work overseas. When you call us you speak to the same person who is actually building your website.</p>
