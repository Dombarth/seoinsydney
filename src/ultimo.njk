<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation services for businesses in Ultimo and the Broadway precinct. Ultimo sits right between the CBD and the inner west and the commercial area along Broadway and Harris Street has a mix of retail, education adjacent businesses and small professional services firms.</p>

<p>Being close to UTS and the TAFE campus means there are a lot of student focused businesses here. Print shops, tutoring services, budget eateries, phone repair shops. But there's also a growing number of professional services and small agencies that have set up in Ultimo because the rents are lower than the CBD but you're still close to everything.</p>

<p>We started working with a phone repair shop on Broadway in 2023 that was getting almost no online enquiries despite being in a high foot traffic area. Their Google Business Profile had about 60 reviews and a 4.8 rating but they weren't showing up in maps searches for anything. Turned out the business had been registered under a slightly different name on Google than what was on their signage, they had no website at all, and there were about 20 old directory listings with wrong phone numbers. We built them a basic website, fixed the GBP, cleaned up the citations and within about four months they were getting 15 to 20 calls a week from Google.</p>

<p>For the retail businesses along Broadway the competition comes from both the local area and nearby suburbs like Glebe and Chippendale. A lot of these businesses don't have websites or if they do its a single page with no real content. Even basic SEO work can make a noticeable difference in an area where most competitors haven't done anything.</p>

<p>Local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees and no contracts of any kind. Month to month with 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All work is done by our Sydney based team. We don't send anything offshore.</p>
