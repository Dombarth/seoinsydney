<p>We provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Ultimo and the surrounding area near UTS and the ABC precinct. We have been working with businesses in this part of inner Sydney since 2015, through the significant development that has reshaped the area around Broadway and Harris Street.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock-in contracts and local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is handled in-house by our Sydney-based team.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape in Ultimo</h2>

<p>Ultimo occupies a transitional space between the Sydney CBD and the inner west. It is home to UTS, the ABC headquarters, and a growing number of technology and media businesses. The area also has a significant residential population and a mix of hospitality and retail businesses serving students, workers and residents.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Ultimo:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Education-adjacent businesses competing for student and campus-related searches</li>
    <li>Tech and media companies with both local and national search needs</li>
    <li>Hospitality venues competing with the nearby CBD and Haymarket dining precincts</li>
    <li>Residential services targeting a dense inner-city population</li>
    <li>Many businesses with outdated websites that have not been optimised since launch</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Ultimo</h2>

<p>We worked with an IT services company near the UTS campus that had been operating for about eight years. They had a decent client base built through referrals but almost no organic search visibility. Their website listed their services on a single page with minimal content and no individual service pages. Over about six months we restructured the site, built out service-specific pages targeting the terms their potential clients were actually searching, optimised their Google Business Profile and built citations across relevant directories. The organic traffic increase was gradual but steady, and they started receiving enquiries from businesses in the area that had found them through search rather than referrals.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in Ultimo overlaps with both Haymarket and the CBD. For cafes and restaurants near Broadway or along Harris Street, the competition for food-related searches is intense. Google Business Profile optimisation is the most immediate lever for these businesses, and many have not set theirs up properly.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service pages</li>
    <li>Content strategy and production</li>
    <li>Link building from relevant sources</li>
    <li>Citation management</li>
    <li>Monthly reporting with clear metrics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Ultimo businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting. For businesses targeting broader searches beyond the immediate area, it usually sits between $1,500 and $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave, everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. Each specialist handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We will do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Ultimo area. It is a written report, not a sales pitch.</p>
