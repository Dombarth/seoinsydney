<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Ultimo and the surrounding areas. We've been working with businesses around Broadway, Harris Street, Jones Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Ultimo has always had a unique mix of education, tech, residential and small retail businesses packed into a tight footprint.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Ultimo sits between the CBD, Haymarket and Pyrmont which means businesses here often compete with much larger operators in adjacent suburbs. Theres a strong presence of IT companies, web development firms, small consultancies and education adjacent businesses particularly around the UTS precinct. For businesses in Ultimo the challenge is usually visibility against CBD competitors who have larger budgets and more established websites. Its a suburb where smart targeted local SEO can make a real difference because most Ultimo businesses haven't invested in it at all.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a small IT support company on Harris Street in late 2020 that had been running for about five years. Two technicians and an office manager. They serviced small businesses and strata buildings across Ultimo, Pyrmont and the CBD but almost all their work came through word of mouth which is where most of their enquiries had always come from. Their website was a single page with a contact form and nothing else. We built out service pages for each of their offerings, created content around common IT issues that their target clients were searching for and sorted out the Google Business Profile. Over about eight months their organic leads went from basically nothing to about four or five per week. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the technical copywriting which a lot of other agencies in this area struggle with.</p>

<p>The food scene around Broadway and the UTS end of Ultimo is busy but transient. Theres a lot of student traffic and office workers during the day. Restaurants and takeaway places in Ultimo that optimise for lunch and delivery searches can pick up a lot of volume because the competition for those specific terms is lower than you'd expect given the foot traffic in the area.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Ultimo businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For IT and professional services companies in Ultimo its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Ultimo business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Ultimo area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
