faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building, and monthly reporting. For businesses targeting broader searches beyond the 2007 postcode, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before work begins."
  - q: "What types of businesses here benefit from SEO?"
    a: "the area has a mix of education-adjacent businesses, technology and media companies near the UTS campus and ABC headquarters, hospitality venues along Broadway and Harris Street, and residential service providers. Any business that serves the local population, students, or workers in the area benefits from local SEO and Google Business Profile optimisation."
  - q: "How does the area's proximity to the CBD affect SEO competition?"
    a: "the area sits directly adjacent to the Sydney CBD, which means some businesses compete with CBD firms for the same search terms. Others focus on genuinely local searches within the 2007 postcode. Understanding which category your business falls into determines the right strategy, budget, and realistic timeline for organic results."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours including content, backlinks, and technical improvements."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area occupies a transitional zone between the Sydney CBD and the inner west, within the 2007 postcode. The area is anchored by the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) campus along Broadway and Harris Street, and the ABC headquarters at the main road. The suburb borders Haymarket and Chinatown to the east, Pyrmont to the north, and Glebe to the west. The area has a significant student population combined with a growing number of technology, media, and creative businesses that have established in the area over the past decade.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate. Many businesses in the area have not invested in search engine optimisation, which creates opportunity for those that do. For hospitality venues competing with the nearby Haymarket and CBD dining precincts, Google Business Profile optimisation provides the most immediate visibility. For technology and professional services businesses, organic search visibility builds a reliable pipeline of enquiries from both local and metropolitan searches.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>The education sector creates a distinct search pattern here. Businesses serving the UTS student population compete for campus-related, student service, and accommodation searches. The presence of UTS also drives demand for technology and IT services from both the university and the companies that have established around it.</p>

<p>The hospitality market here overlaps with both Haymarket and the CBD. Cafes and restaurants along Broadway, Harris Street, and the surrounding streets face competition from the dense Chinatown dining precinct to the east. For these businesses, Google Business Profile optimisation, review management, and local content are the most direct routes to improved search visibility and foot traffic.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses targeting broader searches beyond the immediate area, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
