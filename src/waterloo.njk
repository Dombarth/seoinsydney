<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Waterloo across hospitality, retail, health services and creative industries. Waterloo sits between Redfern and Zetland and has undergone significant change with the Waterloo Metro development and ongoing residential construction. The mix of established businesses along Botany Road, Bourke Street and Danks Street and newer businesses in the apartment precincts creates an evolving commercial landscape.</p>

<p>Danks Street has become a well known destination for homewares, design studios and cafes. The businesses here attract customers from across Sydney not just locally. They need SEO that targets both local searches and broader Sydney searches for their specific categories — furniture, interior design, homewares, specialty dining.</p>

<p>We worked with a homewares store on Danks Street that had been operating for about nine years. They had a strong reputation among interior designers and architects but their online visibility was limited to people who already knew about them. The website was beautiful but slow and had no structure for search engines. We rebuilt the site architecture with proper category and collection pages, improved the site speed significantly and created content around the product categories and styles people were actually searching for. We optimised the GBP and built links from design and interiors publications and directories. Within about eight months their organic traffic increased by about 150% and they were ranking for several homewares and furniture search terms across Sydney. The owner told us they were receiving orders from customers who had found them through Google and had never visited the physical store which opened up a new revenue channel for them.</p>

<p>For the hospitality and retail businesses along Botany Road the metro development will bring increased foot traffic and search activity. Businesses that establish their online presence now will benefit when the station opens.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Ecommerce SEO from $2,000. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts.</p>
