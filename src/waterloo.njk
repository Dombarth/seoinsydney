<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Waterloo and across the inner south. We've been working with businesses around Botany Road, Danks Street, Lachlan Street, Raglan Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Waterloo has changed dramatically with the metro station development and the massive Waterloo Estate redevelopment reshaping the suburb.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Waterloo sits between Redfern, Zetland and Alexandria and has become a busy residential and commercial area. Theres a mix of creative businesses, design showrooms along Danks Street, cafes, restaurants, medical practices and service businesses. For businesses in Waterloo the population is growing rapidly and the customer base is becoming younger and more digitally oriented with the new apartment developments. Its a suburb where local SEO is becoming more important every year because the incoming residents search for everything online rather than discovering businesses through foot traffic.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a design and furniture showroom on Danks Street in late 2021 that had been operating for about six years. They had a strong reputation among interior designers but very little visibility with direct consumers which is where most of their missed opportunities were. Their website was visually appealing but had almost no searchable content and their Google Business Profile was basic. We rebuilt the site with product category pages, created content around interior design trends and styling topics, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and categories and built links from design publications and home styling directories. Over about eight months their direct consumer enquiries from organic search went from about one per week to around five. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the design and lifestyle content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't write well.</p>

<p>The cafe scene on Danks Street and the surrounding area in Waterloo is well established and competitive. New cafes are opening to serve the apartment population. A cafe in Waterloo that maintains strong GBP management and local SEO visibility can capture the daily searches from both the residential population and the design district visitors.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Waterloo businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For retail and design businesses in Waterloo its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many product categories and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Waterloo business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Waterloo area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
