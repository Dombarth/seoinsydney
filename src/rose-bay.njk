<h2>How We Work in Rose Bay</h2>

<p>We worked with a dental practice on New South Head Road that had been operating for about twelve years. They had three dentists and a hygienist with a strong referral network. Their website was functional but had not been updated in several years, and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. Over about four months we updated the site structure with individual treatment pages, optimised the GBP with proper dental categories and service descriptions, and built citations across dental directories. The practice started appearing consistently in local search results and receiving new patient bookings through search.</p>

<p>For waterfront dining venues in Rose Bay, Google Business Profile optimisation captures both local diners and visitors. Photo quality, review management and regular posting are particularly impactful for restaurants with scenic locations because visual search elements play a larger role in dining decisions.</p>
