<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Rose Bay and across the eastern harbourside suburbs. We've been working with businesses along New South Head Road, Dover Road, Old South Head Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Rose Bay has maintained its position as one of Sydneys most desirable addresses which shapes the type of businesses operating here.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Rose Bay is an affluent residential suburb with a small but high quality commercial strip along New South Head Road. Theres a concentration of real estate agencies, medical specialists, financial advisors, boutique retail and premium dining. For businesses in Rose Bay the customer base has high expectations and significant spending capacity. Its a suburb where your online presence needs to communicate quality and credibility because the clientele will research thoroughly before making a decision and they compare multiple options.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a private dental practice near New South Head Road in early 2022 that had been operating for about nine years. Two dentists specialising in cosmetic and restorative dentistry. They were getting most of their patients from referrals and their practice had a strong reputation locally but they weren't visible online for any cosmetic dentistry searches which is where most of the new patient growth opportunities were. Their website was professionally designed but had very little content beyond basic service descriptions. We rebuilt the content with detailed procedure pages for veneers, implants, crowns and whitening, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from dental associations and health directories. Over about eight months their cosmetic dentistry enquiries from organic search went from about one per month to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the dental content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource overseas.</p>

<p>The real estate market in Rose Bay is premium and the agencies here compete intensely for vendor listings. A real estate agency in Rose Bay that invests in SEO for property market content and suburb specific searches can position itself as the local authority which matters a lot when vendors are choosing who to list with.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Rose Bay businesses start from $1,200 per month. For dental practices and medical specialists in Rose Bay its usually between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many services and procedures are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Rose Bay business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Rose Bay area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
