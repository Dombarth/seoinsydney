  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For marine services, health practitioners, and professional services in the area, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2029 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. Niche categories like marine services and specialist retail can see results faster due to lower online competition."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the eastern suburbs including Double Bay, Bondi, Vaucluse, Bellevue Hill, Bondi Junction, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an eastern suburbs harbourside locality within the 2029 postcode, positioned between Double Bay and Vaucluse on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour. The suburb has a distinct character shaped by its waterfront position, with the wharf providing ferry services to Circular Quay and the Sydney Seaplanes terminal operating from the bay. New South Head Road runs through the suburb as the main commercial corridor, with a mix of cafes, restaurants, specialist retail, and professional services. Lyne Park on the foreshore is a focal point for local recreation.</p>

<p>The commercial profile of the area combines local village services with marine-related businesses and professional services that serve the broader eastern suburbs. The suburb's affluent residential base creates demand for high-value services including property, interior design, automotive, health, and financial advisory. Search competition here is moderate for most categories, but the high customer lifetime value in the area means businesses that achieve strong search visibility benefit disproportionately from each enquiry captured through organic search.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
