<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Rose Bay and the surrounding harbourside suburbs. Rose Bay is a quiet but commercially significant area. The businesses here tend to be established, premium and highly referral driven. That last part is both the strength and the problem when it comes to search visibility.</p>

<p>The commercial area along Dover Road and New South Head Road has a mix of real estate agencies, financial planners, medical practices, beauty salons and high end retail. Many of these businesses have operated for years on referrals alone and haven't given much thought to their online presence. But the ones that have invested in SEO are capturing enquiries that would otherwise go to competitors in Double Bay or Bondi Junction.</p>

<p>We started working with a boutique real estate agency on New South Head Road in 2022. They had about eight agents and were well known locally but their website was generating almost no enquiries from organic search. They had a beautiful site that loaded slowly, had no property suburb pages and wasn't optimised for any of the searches their potential vendors were actually making. We rebuilt the site structure, created suburb focused content for Rose Bay, Vaucluse, Bellevue Hill and Point Piper, fixed the speed issues and optimised the GBP. Over about eight months they went from having almost no organic visibility to ranking for key real estate searches across the eastern harbourside suburbs. They estimated organic search contributed to about six vendor appraisals per month which at their average commission was significant.</p>

<p>For professional services businesses in Rose Bay the market is less competitive than you'd expect. Most of the financial planners, accountants and lawyers operating here rely almost entirely on referrals and professional networks. Even basic SEO can generate meaningful results quickly because so few competitors are actively targeting these searches.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts, month to month with 30 days notice.</p>
