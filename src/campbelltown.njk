<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Campbelltown and the Macarthur region including Ingleburn, Minto and Camden. Campbelltown is the major commercial centre of southwestern Sydney's outer ring. Queen Street, the Campbelltown Mall, Macarthur Square and the surrounding commercial areas support a wide range of businesses serving one of Sydney's fastest growing populations.</p>

<p>The Macarthur region is experiencing rapid population growth with new housing developments in areas like Oran Park, Gregory Hills, Leppington and Menangle Park. This growth is creating increasing demand for local services and the businesses that establish strong search visibility now are positioning themselves to benefit from this expanding market for years to come.</p>

<p>We started working with a plumbing company based in Campbelltown in late 2021. They had two vans and were getting most of their work from word of mouth and a few Hipages leads. Their website was a single page with a phone number and a list of services. They were paying about $2,000 per month for Hipages leads with inconsistent quality. We built a proper website with individual service pages — blocked drains, hot water systems, gas fitting, bathroom renovations, emergency plumbing — targeting the Campbelltown, Camden and Macarthur area. We optimised the GBP, got reviews flowing and built links from trade directories and local community sites. Within about five months they were ranking for plumbing searches across the Macarthur region. Their organic leads grew to about twenty per month and they cut their Hipages spend entirely. The owner said the quality of leads from organic search was significantly better and they eventually hired a third plumber to keep up with the volume.</p>

<p>For the medical and professional services businesses around the Campbelltown hospital and town centre the competition is growing but still manageable compared to the inner city. Early investment in SEO creates a foundation thats hard for newer competitors to match.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
