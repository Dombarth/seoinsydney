suburbContext: |
    <p>Campbelltown is the regional centre for the Macarthur region in south-western Sydney, serving as the commercial, retail, and healthcare hub for a large surrounding population. The area has experienced significant growth as residential development expands in the region.</p>
    <p>The business profile includes retail anchored by a major shopping centre, healthcare services centred around the hospital, professional services, trades, education services, and hospitality.</p>
    <p>The regional centre status and distance from other major centres mean businesses serve a largely self-contained market, with residents preferring local services for convenience.</p>
competitionSection: |
    <p>Healthcare faces significant competition given the hospital precinct, with numerous medical and allied health practitioners serving the growing Macarthur population.</p>
    <p>Retail faces competition between the major shopping centre and surrounding commercial areas, with local search visibility important for businesses outside the main retail complex.</p>
    <p>Trades and professional services face moderate competition, with the growing population creating ongoing demand across most service categories.</p>
