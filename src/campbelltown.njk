<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Campbelltown and across the Macarthur region. We've been working with businesses around Queen Street, Hurley Street, Dumaresq Street, Camden Road and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Campbelltown has continued to grow as a major regional centre with the hospital expansion, university precinct and the ongoing residential development in the surrounding suburbs.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Campbelltown is the commercial centre of the Macarthur region serving a large and rapidly growing population. Theres a strong concentration of legal firms around the courthouse, medical specialists near the hospital, real estate agencies, trade businesses and a busy retail and hospitality scene. For businesses in Campbelltown the search volume is growing in line with the population and the online competition is still weak relative to the size of the market. Its a suburb where the businesses that invest in SEO now are building positions that will be extremely valuable as the region continues to grow.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a criminal law firm near Queen Street in early 2022 that had been operating for about seven years. Two solicitors handling traffic offences, drug charges and assault matters. They were getting most of their clients from court duty work and legal aid referrals which is where most of their matters had always come from. Their website was a basic template and their Google Business Profile was not verified. We rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around common criminal law questions and court process topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from legal directories and criminal law associations. Over about eight months their private client enquiries from organic search went from about one per month to around nine. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the legal content which a lot of other agencies in the Macarthur area outsource.</p>

<p>The medical market around Campbelltown Hospital is growing significantly. Specialists who establish strong online visibility in Campbelltown can attract patients from across the Macarthur region, Camden, Wollondilly and beyond because Campbelltown is the primary medical hub for the area and the population is expanding rapidly.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Campbelltown businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For legal firms and medical specialists in Campbelltown its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many practice areas or specialties are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Campbelltown business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Campbelltown area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
