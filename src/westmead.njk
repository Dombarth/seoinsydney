<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Westmead and across the greater Parramatta area. We've been working with businesses around Hawkesbury Road, Railway Parade, Mons Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Westmead has been undergoing a major transformation with the health and education precinct expansion and the new metro line.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Westmead is dominated by its hospital and medical precinct. Theres Westmead Hospital, the Childrens Hospital, the new research facilities and a massive cluster of medical specialists, allied health practitioners, pharmacies and health related services in the surrounding streets. For businesses in Westmead the search environment is heavily weighted towards health and medical terms. Its a suburb where medical practices that invest in SEO can build a strong patient pipeline because the search volume for health services in the Westmead area is substantial and growing.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a specialist radiology practice near Hawkesbury Road in early 2021 that had been operating for about five years. They offered ultrasound, CT and MRI services and were getting most of their referrals through hospital networks and GP relationships which is where most of their patients had always come from. Their website listed their services but had no content explaining the different types of imaging or what patients should expect. We rebuilt the site with individual modality pages, created patient information content, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from medical directories and radiology associations. Over about eight months their direct patient enquiries from organic search increased from almost zero to about ten per week. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the medical imaging content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't have experience writing.</p>

<p>The commercial strip along Hawkesbury Road has a mix of restaurants, retail and service businesses that cater to the hospital workforce and local residents. With the new metro station and the ongoing precinct development the population of Westmead is growing and the demand for local services is increasing. A business in Westmead that invests in local SEO now is positioning itself for a much larger customer base in the coming years.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Westmead businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical specialists and health practices in Westmead its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Westmead business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Westmead area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
