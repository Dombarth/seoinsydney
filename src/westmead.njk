<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Westmead primarily in the areas of allied health, medical services and professional services. Westmead is defined by the hospital precinct. Westmead Hospital, the Children's Hospital, the private hospital and the surrounding research and medical facilities create a unique business environment where health and medical related services dominate the local economy.</p>

<p>The concentration of medical specialists, allied health practitioners and support services around the hospital precinct means the competition for health related search terms is significant. Theres probably more physiotherapists, psychologists, dentists and allied health practices per square kilometre in Westmead than almost anywhere else in western Sydney. Most of them are competing for the same patient searches.</p>

<p>We started working with an allied health practice on Hawkesbury Road in early 2022. They offered physiotherapy, occupational therapy and exercise physiology from a single location near the station. Their website had been built by a friend and had about four pages of generic content. They were relying entirely on hospital referrals and word of mouth. We rebuilt the website with individual service and condition pages, set up the GBP properly with the right categories and attributes, fixed inconsistencies across medical directories and built links from health associations. Over about seven months they started appearing for allied health searches across Westmead, Parramatta, Northmead and Wentworthville. Their self referred patients went from about two per week to roughly eight. The practice manager said it changed how they planned their capacity.</p>

<p>Outside the medical sector Westmead also has a growing number of professional services firms, particularly migration agents and education consultants catering to the local multicultural population. These businesses tend to have less online competition than medical but still benefit significantly from proper local SEO.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Medical and allied health typically $1,500 to $2,000 depending on the number of services being targeted. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
