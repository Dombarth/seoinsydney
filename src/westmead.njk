<h2>How We Work in Westmead</h2>

<p>We worked with a specialist paediatric practice near the Children's Hospital that had been operating for about seven years. They had two specialists and were receiving most of their referrals through the hospital network. Their website was a basic page with practitioner bios and a phone number. Over about six months we rebuilt the site with individual condition pages targeting the specific health concerns parents were searching for, optimised the Google Business Profile with proper specialist categories and built citations across medical and paediatric directories. The practice started receiving direct enquiries from parents who found them through search rather than solely through hospital referrals.</p>

<p>For non-medical businesses in Westmead, the search approach focuses on the local population and the hospital workforce. Cafes, restaurants and local services near the precinct benefit from Google Business Profile optimisation and local search visibility targeting the high foot traffic the hospitals generate.</p>
