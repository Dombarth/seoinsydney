faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues competing in the Chinatown dining precinct or professional services near Central Station, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,200. Written quote with a full breakdown provided before work begins."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO here?"
    a: "the area has intense competition for dining and food-related search terms due to the concentration of restaurants in Chinatown. For hospitality businesses, Google Business Profile optimisation and review management are the primary competitive levers. For non-hospitality businesses, competition is more moderate and local SEO campaigns can produce results within three to six months."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Sydney including the CBD, Ultimo, Surry Hills, Darlinghurst, and all suburbs in the metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to each business and its specific search landscape."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area sits on the southern edge of the Sydney CBD within the 2000 postcode, centred on the Chinatown precinct along Dixon Street and Sussex Street. The area is bounded by Central Station to the south, Darling Harbour to the west, and the CBD core to the north. The area contains one of the densest concentrations of restaurants and food businesses in Sydney, alongside Paddy's Markets, the Capitol Theatre, and a growing number of accommodation and service businesses catering to both residents and visitors.</p>

<p>Search competition here is highly concentrated in the hospitality sector. Restaurants, cafes, and food businesses along Dixon Street and in the broader Chinatown area compete intensely for dining-related search terms, food delivery queries, and cuisine-specific searches. For non-hospitality businesses near Central Station and along George Street, the competition is more moderate, and targeted local SEO can establish visibility in a market where many competitors have not invested in search optimisation.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues in the competitive Chinatown dining market, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,200. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
