<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Haymarket and across the Chinatown precinct. We've been working with businesses around Sussex Street, Dixon Street, Thomas Street, Goulburn Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Haymarket has always been one of the busiest commercial pockets in Sydney particularly around the markets and Chinatown.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Haymarket is dominated by hospitality, retail and education services. Theres a massive concentration of restaurants and food outlets around Dixon Street and the Chinatown precinct and the competition for food related searches is some of the tightest in Sydney. For businesses in Haymarket the challenge is standing out in a market where there are literally hundreds of similar businesses within a few blocks of each other. Its also a suburb with a lot of international student facing businesses and migration services which creates its own set of search dynamics.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a migration agency near Goulburn Street in early 2022 that had been operating for about four years. Two registered agents and a small admin team. They were getting most of their clients from community referrals and WeChat groups which is where most of their enquiries had always come from. Their website was in both English and Mandarin but the English version had almost no SEO and the Google Business Profile was missing several key categories. We restructured the site with individual visa category pages in English, sorted out the GBP, built links from migration industry directories and created content targeting specific visa related searches. Over about seven months their English language enquiries went from about three a month to around twelve. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all the English language SEO in house which a lot of other agencies around Haymarket don't specialise in.</p>

<p>The restaurant market in Haymarket is probably the most competitive food market in Sydney by sheer density. Theres hundreds of restaurants within the Chinatown precinct alone. Most rely on foot traffic and delivery apps but the ones that have invested in GBP management and local SEO tend to capture a disproportionate share of the search traffic in Haymarket because so few bother.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Haymarket businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For migration agencies and professional services firms in Haymarket its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how many visa categories or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Haymarket business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Haymarket area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
