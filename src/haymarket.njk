faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Haymarket business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Haymarket businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting. For restaurants and retail businesses in the Chinatown precinct, that range is usually sufficient."
  - q: "Can SEO help multilingual businesses in Haymarket?"
    a: "Yes. Many Haymarket businesses serve both English and Chinese-speaking customers. SEO can be structured to target searches in both languages, though this requires separate content and keyword research for each language. We can advise on whether a bilingual approach makes sense for your specific business."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO for restaurants in Haymarket?"
    a: "Haymarket and Chinatown have an extremely high density of restaurants and food businesses. For dining searches, Google Business Profile optimisation is the most impactful lever. Most restaurants in the area have not invested in this properly, so even basic optimisation can create meaningful separation from competitors."
  - q: "Do you work with retail businesses in Haymarket?"
    a: "Yes. We work with retail businesses in the Haymarket precinct including those around Market City and the Chinatown retail strips. For retail, local SEO and Google Shopping visibility are both relevant depending on whether you sell online."

<p>We provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Haymarket, including the Chinatown precinct and the area around Central Station and Darling Harbour. We have been working with businesses in this area since 2016. Haymarket is one of Sydney's most commercially dense suburbs with an exceptionally high concentration of restaurants, retail and service businesses.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock-in contracts and local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is handled in-house by our Sydney-based team.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape in Haymarket</h2>

<p>Haymarket encompasses Chinatown, the southern end of the CBD around Central Station, and the eastern edge of Darling Harbour. The area has one of the highest concentrations of food and dining businesses per square kilometre in Australia, alongside a significant number of retail businesses, accommodation providers and professional services firms.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Haymarket:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extremely high restaurant and food business density in the Chinatown precinct</li>
    <li>Multilingual search demand in both English and Chinese</li>
    <li>Retail competition around Market City and the surrounding shopping strips</li>
    <li>Tourism-adjacent businesses competing for visitor searches</li>
    <li>Overlap with CBD and Ultimo searches for many service businesses</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Haymarket</h2>

<p>We worked with a medical practice near Central Station that served a largely Chinese-speaking patient base. They had a website in English only with minimal content and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. Over about six months we rebuilt the site with bilingual content targeting both English and Chinese health searches, optimised their GBP with proper categories and service descriptions, and built citations across both general and Chinese-language business directories. The practice saw a meaningful increase in new patient enquiries from both language groups.</p>

<p>For restaurants in the Chinatown precinct, the challenge is standing out among hundreds of competitors. Google Business Profile is where most of the value sits for dining searches. Review volume, photo quality, correct categories, menu uploads and regular posting all contribute to visibility in the map pack. Many restaurants in Haymarket have set up their GBP but have not maintained it.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service and product pages</li>
    <li>Multilingual content strategy where relevant</li>
    <li>Link building from relevant local and industry sources</li>
    <li>Citation management across directories</li>
    <li>Monthly reporting with clear metrics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Haymarket businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting.
