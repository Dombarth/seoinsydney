<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation and local SEO for businesses in Haymarket and the Chinatown precinct. The area around Dixon Street, Thomas Street and Sussex Street has one of the highest concentrations of restaurants and food businesses in Sydney and the competition for visibility in this area is unlike anywhere else in the city.</p>

<p>Haymarket is dominated by food and hospitality. Chinese restaurants, Asian grocery stores, dumpling houses, bubble tea shops, dessert bars. Theres also a significant number of health practitioners, immigration agents and education consultants operating in the area, many of whom serve Chinese and Asian speaking communities. The search landscape is more complex here because a lot of potential customers are searching in languages other than English.</p>

<p>We started working with a dumpling restaurant on Dixon Street in mid 2022. They had been relying entirely on food delivery apps and walk in traffic. No website, a Google Business Profile with about 200 reviews but incomplete information, and they weren't showing up in any map searches. We set up a website with a menu, built out the GBP properly, handled translations for some key pages and cleaned up about 30 directory listings. Their walk in traffic from Google Maps increased noticeably within about three months and they started getting catering enquiries they'd never had before.</p>

<p>For the professional services in Haymarket like immigration agents and education consultants the challenge is different. These businesses are competing across a wider area and often need to rank for both English and Chinese language search terms. Its a specialised area of SEO and most agencies don't know how to handle multilingual search properly.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No contracts, month to month, 30 days notice. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Everything is done by our Sydney based team. We don't outsource offshore.</p>
