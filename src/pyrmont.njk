faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For technology companies or professional services targeting broader Sydney or national searches, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Pricing depends on competition level, keyword scope, and technical requirements. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking movement within three to six months. The 2009 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches but higher competition for technology and media-related terms. Google Business Profile improvements for hospitality and retail businesses can produce faster initial results."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Sydney including Ultimo, Glebe, the CBD, Balmain, and all suburbs in the metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape and industry of each business."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours including content, backlinks, and technical improvements."
testimonialQuote: "We relied entirely on word of mouth for years. Now about half our new clients find us through Google. The consistency of the enquiries month to month is what surprised me most."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area occupies a peninsula on the western edge of the Sydney CBD in the 2009 postcode. The area is bordered by Darling Harbour to the east, Blackwattle Bay to the west, and connects to Ultimo and Glebe along Harris Street and the area Bridge Road corridor. The area has transitioned from an industrial waterfront precinct into a dense residential and commercial area with a strong concentration of technology companies, media organisations, creative agencies, and hospitality venues. The Star casino and entertainment precinct, the Sydney Fish Market, and the ICC Sydney convention centre are significant local landmarks.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate for local services but higher for technology and media-related terms. Many businesses in the area serve both local and metropolitan clients, which creates a split search strategy requirement. For restaurants, cafes, and entertainment venues around Darling Harbour and Jones Bay, Google Business Profile optimisation and review management are the primary drivers of search visibility.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For technology companies or professional services targeting broader Sydney searches, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,500. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
