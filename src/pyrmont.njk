<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Pyrmont and across the Darling Harbour precinct. We've been working with businesses around Harris Street, Pyrmont Bridge Road, Union Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Pyrmont has changed substantially with all the development around the old fish markets site and the tech sector moving in.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Pyrmont has shifted from a primarily residential and hospitality area to one of Sydneys main tech and media hubs. Theres a high concentration of SaaS companies, digital agencies, media organisations and production studios particularly around the Darling Island and Jones Bay Wharf areas. For businesses in Pyrmont the competition online tends to be against other inner city suburbs rather than within Pyrmont itself because the suburb is relatively small geographically. Its a different dynamic to working in the CBD.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a strata management company near Harris Street in early 2021 that managed about forty buildings across Pyrmont and Ultimo. They had been operating for about ten years but their website was outdated and they had almost no organic presence which is where most of their lead generation problems came from. We rebuilt the site with suburb specific pages, building management content and proper service descriptions. We sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from strata industry directories and property management publications. Over about nine months their organic enquiries went from maybe one a month to about six or seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that work in house including the content and outreach which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The food and dining scene in Pyrmont is competitive but concentrated. Jones Bay Wharf, the Star precinct and Pyrmont Bridge Road all have clusters of restaurants and cafes. Most of them rely heavily on their proximity to Darling Harbour for foot traffic. A Pyrmont restaurant that invests in local SEO and GBP management can pick up a lot of the searches from tourists and visitors who are searching for nearby dining options.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Pyrmont businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For tech companies and professional services firms in Pyrmont its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many services and locations are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Pyrmont clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Pyrmont strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Pyrmont area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
