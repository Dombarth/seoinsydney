<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation and local SEO services for businesses in Pyrmont. The area around Harris Street, Pyrmont Bridge Road and down towards the fish markets has a pretty unique mix of businesses. Lots of media companies, tech firms, some hospitality around the casino precinct and a growing number of residential services as more apartment buildings go up.</p>

<p>Pyrmont is interesting from an SEO perspective because the businesses here tend to fall into two categories. You've got the tech and media companies who need to rank for service terms across Sydney or nationally, and then you've got the local hospitality and retail businesses who need to show up in maps results for people in the area. The approach for each is completely different.</p>

<p>One of our longer running clients is a small software company on Harris Street that we picked up in 2020. They had a website that looked fine but it was built entirely in JavaScript which meant Google couldn't crawl half of it. Their blog had about 50 posts that were all thin content written by a previous agency, none of it was ranking for anything. We rebuilt the site on a proper framework, rewrote the key service pages, pruned the dead blog content and built links from relevant tech publications. They went from about 200 organic visits a month to over 2,000 within about fourteen months.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses around here the challenge is more local. The restaurants near the fish markets and along Union Street are competing for "restaurant Pyrmont" and "dinner near me" type searches. Google Business Profile optimisation is critical for these businesses and most of them haven't touched theirs since they set it up.</p>

<p>Local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. For national or competitive terms its higher. Written quote with full breakdown before we start anything. No setup fees and no lock in contracts.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. We don't outsource work offshore and I review every strategy personally.</p>
