The approach depends on whether your primary audience is local or national."

<h2>The Search Landscape in Pyrmont</h2>

<p>Pyrmont is home to a significant concentration of technology companies, media organisations, creative agencies and startups. The area around the old wharves and along Harris Street has become one of Sydney's primary tech corridors, sitting alongside established residential and hospitality businesses.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Pyrmont:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High density of tech and media companies with sophisticated digital presence</li>
    <li>Mix of businesses targeting local and national search terms</li>
    <li>Growing hospitality sector around the waterfront and casino precinct</li>
    <li>Residential services competing for local searches in a compact area</li>
    <li>Many businesses with strong websites but underdeveloped organic strategies</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Pyrmont</h2>

<p>We started working with a SaaS company near Jones Bay Road in 2021 that had built a solid product but had almost no organic visibility outside of branded searches. They had a well-built website from a development perspective, but the content structure was not aligned with how their potential customers were searching. Over about seven months we restructured their content architecture, built out category pages around their core use cases and developed a link building strategy focused on industry publications and comparison sites. The result was a steady increase in non-branded organic traffic that compounded over time.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in Pyrmont has grown considerably with the waterfront dining precinct and the developments around The Star. For restaurants and cafes, Google Business Profile optimisation and local search visibility are the primary drivers. Most venues in the area have not invested in this properly, which creates an opportunity for those that do.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service and product pages</li>

    <li>Link building from relevant industry and local sources</li>
