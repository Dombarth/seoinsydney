suburbContext: |
    <p>Alexandria is an inner-south suburb known for its large-format retail outlets, commercial warehousing, and converted industrial spaces. The area sits adjacent to the airport and has transport connections across the metropolitan region.</p>
    <p>The business profile includes homeware and furniture retailers, automotive services, fitness centres, warehousing, and an emerging food and beverage scene in converted warehouse spaces.</p>
    <p>The location makes the area a destination for shoppers from across the city seeking large-format retail that cannot fit in traditional shopping centres.</p>
competitionSection: |
    <p>Local retail businesses compete differently than traditional shopping strips. Large-format retailers often compete on product range and price rather than purely local search visibility.</p>
    <p>The automotive services cluster creates specific competitive dynamics for mechanics, detailers, and related businesses serving the broader metropolitan market.</p>
    <p>Food and beverage businesses in converted warehouse spaces compete for the discovery-based searches from inner-city and inner-west residents.</p>
