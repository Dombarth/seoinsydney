<h2>How We Work in Alexandria</h2>

<p>We worked with a design furniture showroom in a converted warehouse on Bourke Road that had strong in-person traffic but minimal online visibility. Their website was image-heavy but had almost no crawlable text content. Over about five months we restructured the site with proper product category pages, added content describing their collections and design philosophy, optimised the Google Business Profile and built links from design and interiors publications. The showroom started receiving enquiries from people who found them through search.</p>
