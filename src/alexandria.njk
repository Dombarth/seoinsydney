<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Alexandria and across the inner south. We've been working with businesses around Botany Road, McEvoy Street, Bourke Road, O'Riordan Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Alexandria has transformed from a primarily industrial suburb into one of the most dynamic mixed use areas in Sydney.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Alexandria has a unique mix of converted warehouse businesses, creative agencies, tech companies, fitness studios, breweries, cafes and an increasing residential population in the apartment developments along the Green Square corridor. For businesses in Alexandria the market is competitive because you're surrounded by other businesses that tend to be digitally savvy and have a natural understanding of online presence. Its a suburb where doing nothing online means falling behind quickly because your competitors are already investing in their visibility.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a CrossFit gym near Bourke Road in early 2021 that had been operating for about four years. Two coaches and a growing membership. They were getting most of their members from Instagram and referrals which is where most of their sign ups had always come from. Their website was a Wix page with a timetable and their Google Business Profile was minimal. We rebuilt the site with pages for each training program, created content around fitness goals and training approaches, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and class information and built links from fitness directories and health publications. Over about six months their new member enquiries from organic search went from about one per week to around eight. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the fitness content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The cafe and dining scene in Alexandria is growing rapidly with new venues opening in converted warehouse spaces. Most of them build a following on social media but miss the organic search traffic from people searching for cafes and restaurants in the area. A hospitality business in Alexandria that invests in local SEO and GBP management can capture the daily searches from the large and growing working and residential population.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Alexandria businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For fitness businesses and creative agencies in Alexandria its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many services and areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Alexandria business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Alexandria area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
