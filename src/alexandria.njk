<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Alexandria across the areas of ecommerce, creative agencies, hospitality and trades. Alexandria has become one of Sydney's most dynamic business suburbs. The mix of converted warehouses, creative studios, cafes and industrial businesses along Botany Road, Bourke Road, McEvoy Street and the backstreets creates a unique commercial environment.</p>

<p>The ecommerce and direct to consumer brands that have set up in Alexandria's warehouse spaces are a growing part of our client base. These businesses often have strong products and social media followings but haven't invested in organic search. They're paying for all their traffic through paid ads when there are significant organic opportunities they're missing.</p>

<p>We started working with a homewares brand operating from a warehouse on Bourke Road in 2022. They were doing about $80,000 per month in revenue almost entirely through Instagram ads and Google Shopping. Their organic traffic was minimal because the website had been built for conversions but not for search. We restructured the site with proper category pages, built out product collection content around the terms people were actually searching for and created a handful of informational pages targeting buyer intent keywords. We also did technical cleanup — site speed, internal linking, schema markup. Over about ten months their organic traffic went from about 3% of total sessions to roughly 18%. That represented a meaningful amount of revenue that wasn't dependent on ad spend. The founder said it was the first time they felt like the business wasn't completely reliant on Facebook and Google ads to survive.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses around the Alexandria industrial area and along Botany Road the market is competitive but still manageable. The cafe and restaurant scene here attracts workers from surrounding offices and residents from Zetland and Waterloo.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Ecommerce SEO from $2,000. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
