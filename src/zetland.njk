    <p>The business profile includes cafes, restaurants, retail within mixed-use developments, fitness centres, childcare, and convenience services. The rapid population growth has created opportunities for new businesses serving the local community.</p>
    <p>The high proportion of apartment dwellers creates specific demand patterns different from established suburban areas, with businesses adapting to serve a younger, often professional demographic.</p>
