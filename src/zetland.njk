<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Zetland and the surrounding Green Square precinct. Zetland has undergone one of the largest urban transformations in Sydney over the past decade. What was mostly industrial land is now a high density residential area with thousands of apartments and a rapidly growing population of young professionals and families.</p>

<p>The businesses that have set up in Zetland are mostly serving this new residential population. Cafes, restaurants, gyms, medical centres, dental practices, beauty salons and convenience retail. The interesting thing about Zetland from an SEO perspective is that its a new market. Many of these businesses have only been operating for a few years which means the competitive landscape in search isn't as established as in older suburbs. There are genuine first mover advantages for businesses that invest in SEO now.</p>

<p>We worked with a new medical centre near East Village that opened in 2022. They had two GPs and were looking to build a patient base quickly in a suburb where most residents hadn't yet established relationships with local healthcare providers. The website was clean but had minimal content and the GBP was set up but not optimised. We built out individual service pages, created content around the health needs of the local demographic — young adult health, women's health, children's health, corporate health checks — optimised the GBP with proper categories and pushed for early reviews. Within about five months they were appearing in the map pack for GP and medical centre searches across Zetland, Waterloo and Rosebery. Their new patient bookings from organic search grew steadily to about 30 per month which exceeded their initial projections.</p>

<p>For the hospitality businesses in Zetland the competition is growing as more cafes and restaurants open to serve the expanding population. Early investment in local SEO creates a foundation that becomes harder for new competitors to overtake.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
