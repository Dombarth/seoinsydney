  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2017 postcode has moderate to low competition for most local service categories. The growing population in the Green Square area is increasing search demand, creating opportunities for early movers."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner south including Alexandria, Waterloo, Rosebery, Mascot, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner south suburb within the 2017 postcode, forming part of the Green Square urban renewal area. The suburb has undergone rapid transformation from an industrial precinct to a high-density residential and mixed-use area. East Village shopping centre on O'Dea Avenue is the main retail and dining destination, with supermarkets, specialty retail, and restaurants. The Green Square Town Centre development continues to expand the commercial and community facilities in the area. Green Square station on the T8 Airport and South Line provides direct train access to the CBD and airport.</p>

<p>The growing residential population of the area creates increasing search demand for local services. The high-density apartment living in the area drives demand for health practitioners, fitness studios, childcare, dining, and convenience services that are walkable from residential buildings. For businesses in East Village and the surrounding commercial areas, local SEO captures enquiries from a population that is growing faster than the commercial supply in many categories. This means businesses that establish search visibility early here can build dominant positions before competition increases to match the growing population.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
