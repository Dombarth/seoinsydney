<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Zetland and across the Green Square precinct. We've been working with businesses around Defries Avenue, Gadigal Avenue, Joynton Avenue and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Zetland has been one of the fastest growing suburbs in Sydney with the apartment developments and the Green Square town centre completely transforming the area.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Zetland is a new suburb in many ways. The population has grown rapidly and the businesses that service them are still establishing their positions online. Theres a growing number of cafes, restaurants, medical practices, dental clinics, fitness studios and retail businesses opening to serve the apartment population. For businesses in Zetland the opportunity is significant because the online competition is still relatively thin compared to the actual population density. Its a suburb where investing in SEO now means building positions before the market becomes crowded.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a GP clinic near Gadigal Avenue in mid 2022 that had opened about two years earlier. Two GPs serving the growing apartment population in Zetland and Waterloo. They were getting most of their patients from walk ins and building management referrals which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was a simple Squarespace page with opening hours and a contact form and their Google Business Profile was set up but not optimised. We rebuilt the site with individual health service pages, created content around common GP consultation topics, sorted out the GBP with proper categories and appointment information and built links from medical directories. Over about six months their new patient registrations from organic search went from about three per week to around ten. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the medical content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The cafe and dining market in Zetland is developing rapidly. New venues are opening regularly to serve the growing population. A hospitality business in Zetland that invests in local SEO and GBP management early can establish itself as a go to option for the thousands of new residents who search for dining options on their phones.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Zetland businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical practices and dental clinics in Zetland its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Zetland business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Zetland area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
