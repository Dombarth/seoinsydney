faqs:
  - q: "How much does it cost?"
    a: "Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month. If you are a cosmetic clinic or a dental practice on Bay Street where the competition is heavy it is usually $1,500 to $2,500 and sometimes more if you are going after really competitive terms. I send a written quote before I start so you know what you are paying for."
  - q: "How long before you see results?"
    a: "Most businesses see real movement in three to six months. But GBP work can kick in faster, I had a dermatologist on Cross Street go from page two to the map pack within about eight weeks just from getting the categories and citations sorted out. If you already have a decent Google Business Profile with reviews it tends to move quicker."
  - q: "Do you work outside Double Bay?"
    a: "Yes. Most of my work is in the eastern suburbs because that is where I started but I work across Sydney, Rose Bay and Bondi Junction and Woollahra and Paddington and Darling Point and the CBD too. I only take one client per industry in each area so I am never ranking two businesses against each other."
  - q: "Is there a contract?"
    a: "No. There is no contract, you give me 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content I wrote stays on your site and the backlinks stay and the GBP improvements stay. I dont pull anything down or hold anything hostage and I never have."
testimonialQuote: "The enquiries are completely different now, we used to get a lot of people shopping around on price but the ones coming through Google now already know what they want and they book straight away, we would rather have 10 good enquiries a month than 50 tyre kickers."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters Here</h2>

<p>Double Bay sits between Darling Point and Rose Bay on the harbour side and the 2028 postcode covers all three, so when Google decides what to show for a local search in Double Bay it sometimes pulls in businesses from Darling Point and Rose Bay too. Bay Street and Cross Street are where most of the shops and restaurants and clinics are, it is a small area but there is a lot packed in there, luxury retail and fine dining and beauty clinics and professional offices all within a few hundred metres of each other.</p>

<p>The Intercontinental hotel is right there on the waterfront and people come to Double Bay from all over the eastern suburbs to shop and eat, it has that village feel to it and that is part of why the local search competition is so heavy. The Wharf has ferry access to Circular Quay and that brings foot traffic into the area too, so if your business is near the ferry people are searching on their phones as they get off the boat.</p>

<p>Most of the businesses here are high end, medical aesthetics clinics and dermatologists and dental practices and boutique fashion and fine dining, and the customers have money to spend so the lifetime value of a single client is high. Search competition is above average because the businesses here already invest in marketing, a cosmetic clinic on Bay Street might be spending $3,000 a month on Google Ads and still want to rank organically as well, so you are not competing against businesses that are doing nothing. So the SEO work here has to be more aggressive than it would be in a quieter suburb, more content and more link building and a tighter GBP setup, because the businesses you are competing against are already doing some of this stuff.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month and that covers the GBP work and the on-page SEO and the citations and the reporting, everything. Medical aesthetics and luxury retail and professional services cost more because the competition is heavier, those campaigns usually sit around $1,500 to $2,500 a month and sometimes higher if you are going after really competitive terms like dermatologist Double Bay or cosmetic clinic eastern suburbs. Written quote with full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>There is no contract, you give me 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content and the backlinks and the GBP work, I dont pull anything down. I do the work myself and you can ring me directly if you have a question, you are not dealing with an account manager who hands everything off to someone in the Philippines. And if you do stop the content stays on your site, the backlinks stay, the GBP improvements stay, I dont remove anything.</p>
