<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Double Bay across the areas of cosmetic medicine, luxury retail, professional services and high end hospitality. Double Bay is a premium market. The businesses here charge more, the clients expect more and the competition for search visibility reflects that.</p>

<p>The commercial hub along Bay Street, Cross Street and Knox Street has always attracted businesses that cater to an affluent clientele. Cosmetic clinics, dermatologists, financial advisors, family lawyers, boutique real estate agencies. These are high value lead businesses where a single new client from organic search can be worth thousands of dollars. As such the investment in SEO here tends to pay for itself quickly.</p>

<p>We worked with a cosmetic clinic on Cross Street that had been open for about four years. They had a good reputation from referrals and their doctors were well credentialed but they were essentially invisible in Google. When someone searched for cosmetic procedures in the eastern suburbs they weren't showing up. The website was built by a design agency that understood aesthetics but not search. We restructured the entire site around individual treatment pages, built proper service schemas, fixed the GBP, sorted out about 40 directory listings and built links from medical and cosmetic directories. Took about eight months before they were consistently appearing for their key treatment terms across the eastern suburbs. They told us organic search became their second largest referral channel after word of mouth which says more than any sales pitch.</p>

<p>The competition in Double Bay is interesting because a lot of businesses here have had websites for years and accumulated decent authority without ever doing formal SEO. That means the baseline is higher than in newer commercial areas. But it also means most competitors aren't actively optimising so there are usually gaps to exploit.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. For medical and cosmetic industries its typically $1,800 to $2,500 depending on the number of treatments being targeted. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
