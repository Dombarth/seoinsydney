faqs:
  - q: "How much does it cost?"
    a: "Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month. If you are a cosmetic clinic or a dental practice on Bay Street where the competition is heavy it is usually $1,500 to $2,500 and sometimes more if you are going after really competitive terms. I send a written quote before I start so you know what you are paying for."
  - q: "How long before you see results?"
    a: "Most businesses see real movement in three to six months. But GBP work can kick in faster, I had a dermatologist on Cross Street go from page two to the map pack within about eight weeks just from getting the categories and citations sorted out. If you already have a decent Google Business Profile with reviews it tends to move quicker."
  - q: "Do you work outside Double Bay?"
    a: "Yes. Most of my work is in the eastern suburbs because that is where I started but I work across Sydney, Rose Bay and Bondi Junction and Woollahra and Paddington and Darling Point and the CBD too. I only take one client per industry in each area so I am never ranking two businesses against each other."
  - q: "Is there a contract?"
    a: "No. There is no contract, you give me 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content I wrote stays on your site and the backlinks stay and the GBP improvements stay. I dont pull anything down or hold anything hostage and I never have."
testimonialQuote: "The enquiries are completely different now, we used to get a lot of people shopping around on price but the ones coming through Google now already know what they want and they book straight away, we would rather have 10 good enquiries a month than 50 tyre kickers."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters Here</h2>

<p>Double Bay sits between Darling Point and Rose Bay on the harbour side and the 2028 postcode covers all three, so when Google decides what to show for a local search in Double Bay it sometimes pulls in businesses from Darling Point and Rose Bay too. Bay Street and Cross Street are where most of the shops and restaurants and clinics are, it is a small area but there is a lot packed in there, luxury retail and fine dining and beauty clinics and professional offices all within a few hundred metres of each other.</p>

<p>The Intercontinental hotel is right there on the waterfront and people come to Double Bay from all over the eastern suburbs to shop and eat, it has that village feel to it and that is part of why the local search competition is so heavy. The Wharf has ferry access to Circular Quay and that brings foot traffic into the area too, so if your business is near the ferry people are searching on their phones as they get off the boat.</p>

<p>Most of the businesses here are high end, medical aesthetics clinics and dermatologists and dental practices and boutique fashion and fine dining, and the customers have money to spend so the lifetime value of a single client is high. Search competition is above average because the businesses here already invest in marketing, a cosmetic clinic on Bay Street might be spending $3,000 a month on Google Ads and still want to rank organically as well, so you are not competing against businesses that are doing nothing. So the SEO work here has to be more aggressive than it would be in a quieter suburb, more content and more link building and a tighter GBP setup, because the businesses you are competing against are already doing some of this stuff.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Most campaigns start at $1,200 a month and that covers the GBP work and the on-page SEO and the citations and the reporting, everything. Medical aesthetics and luxury retail and professional services cost more because the competition is heavier, those campaigns usually sit around $1,500 to $2,500 a month and sometimes higher if you are going after really competitive terms like dermatologist Double Bay or cosmetic clinic eastern suburbs. Written quote with full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>There is no contract, you give me 30 days notice if you want to stop and everything stays yours, the content and the backlinks and the GBP work, I dont pull anything down. I do the work myself and you can ring me directly if you have a question, you are not dealing with an account manager who hands everything off to someone in the Philippines. And if you do stop the content stays on your site, the backlinks stay, the GBP improvements stay, I dont remove anything.</p>

<p>Text me or give me a call on 0400 454 859 and I will have a look at your site and tell you where you stand, no charge for that.</p>

<h2>What I Actually Do</h2>

<h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>I go through your Google Business Profile and fix the categories and the attributes, and I set up the posts and the Q and A section too, most businesses I see in Double Bay have the wrong primary category set or they are missing attributes that actually affect whether you show up in the map pack.</p>

<h3>Citations</h3>
<p>Your business name and address and phone number need to be exactly the same across every directory, and I see mismatches all the time in Double Bay, sometimes a business has their old phone number on 6 different directories and the current one on their website and Google does not know which is right. I go through about 43 directories and fix everything so it matches and then build citations on the ones that actually help with local rankings.</p>

<h3>Technical SEO</h3>
<p>Site speed and crawl errors and internal linking and schema markup and Core Web Vitals, the stuff no one wants to hear about but if your site takes nine seconds to load on mobile then none of the other SEO work is going to do anything for you.</p>

<h3>Content and Keywords</h3>
<p>I do the keyword research based on what people in the eastern suburbs actually type into Google and sometimes that is very different to what you think they search for, I had a cosmetic clinic in Double Bay that wanted to rank for anti ageing treatments but most of the search volume was for things like lip filler Double Bay and botox eastern suburbs.</p>

    <p><strong>"We were with another agency for about 14 months paying $2200 a month and the rankings barely moved, Dom found that our Google Business Profile had the wrong address on it and half our citations were pointing to the old location from before we moved, took about 4 months but we are now top 3 for our main terms."</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>"Happy with the results overall, organic traffic is up and we are getting more bookings through the website than before. The audit at the start took about a week though which was longer than I thought it would be, but to be fair it was very detailed and he found things the last agency never picked up on."</strong></p>

        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Audit and Research</h3>
            <p>First thing I do is go through your site and your Google Business Profile and your citations and I look at what your competitors in Double Bay are doing, who is ranking for the terms you want and why they are ranking, and the audit takes about three to four days and you get a written document at the end with everything I found, not a sales pitch just a list of what is wrong and what I would do about it.</p>

        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Strategy and Implementation</h3>
            <p>Then I build the campaign based on what the audit turned up and I do the technical fixes and the content and the citation building myself, you are not dealing with a junior account manager who has never actually ranked a website.</p>

        <div class="step-number">3</div>
        <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Monthly Reporting</h3>
            <p>Every month I send a written report covering what I did and what moved and what did not, I dont send a dashboard full of graphs with no context because that is what the big agencies do and it tells you nothing, if something went backwards I tell you that and I tell you why and what I am changing. Most of my clients have been with me for years and I think that is because they can see exactly what they are paying for every month.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Nearby Areas</h2>

<p>Most of my Double Bay work overlaps with Rose Bay and Darling Point because of the postcode, but I also work with businesses in Woollahra and Paddington and Bondi Junction and Edgecliff and Point Piper and across the eastern suburbs too.</p>

<p>Most of my clients find me through referrals from other businesses I work with in the eastern suburbs and I think that says more than anything on this page. I answer my phone and I am on time with deadlines and I fix things when they go wrong, and that sounds like it should be normal but a lot of SEO people in Sydney dont even do that.</p>

<p>Text me or call 0400 454 859 and I will have a look at your site and tell you where you stand.</p>
