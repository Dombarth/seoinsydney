<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Double Bay and across the eastern harbourside suburbs. We've been working with businesses around Bay Street, Cross Street, Knox Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Double Bay has reinvented itself over the past few years with new dining precincts and a wave of luxury retail and professional services moving in.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Double Bay is one of Sydneys most affluent suburbs and the business mix reflects that. Theres high end fashion boutiques, cosmetic clinics, luxury real estate agencies, private wealth advisors, medical specialists and a growing dining scene around the Cross Street and Bay Street intersection. For businesses in Double Bay the customers are high value and they research thoroughly before committing. Its a suburb where your online presence needs to match the quality of the service you provide because the clientele expect it.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a cosmetic surgery clinic on Cross Street in late 2021 that had two surgeons and a team of cosmetic nurses. They had been operating in Double Bay for about five years and were getting most of their consultations from referrals and social media which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website had procedure pages but they were thin on content and the site wasn't ranking for any cosmetic surgery related searches. We rebuilt the content on each procedure page with detailed information, created before and after case study pages, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from medical directories and cosmetic surgery publications. Over about ten months their organic consultation bookings went from about two per month to around ten. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all the medical content in house which a lot of other agencies in Double Bay outsource to writers who don't understand the regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>The luxury retail scene in Double Bay is competitive but most of the boutiques rely on foot traffic and social media. A high end retailer in Double Bay that invests in SEO for product and brand specific searches can capture customers who are researching purchases online before visiting in person.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Double Bay businesses start from $1,200 per month. For cosmetic clinics and medical specialists in Double Bay its usually between $2,000 and $3,000 depending on how many procedures and services are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Double Bay business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Double Bay area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
