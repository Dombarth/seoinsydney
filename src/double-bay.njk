<h2>The Search Landscape in Double Bay</h2>

<p>Double Bay is one of Sydney's premium commercial suburbs with a business mix that reflects its affluent residential base. The area has a significant concentration of specialist medical practices, cosmetic clinics, financial advisors, premium retailers and dining venues. The search competition is shaped by the high-value nature of the services and products offered.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Double Bay:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High concentration of cosmetic and specialist medical practices</li>
    <li>Premium retail competing for product and brand searches</li>
    <li>Financial services and wealth management firms</li>

</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Double Bay</h2>

<p>We worked with a cosmetic clinic on Cross Street that had been operating for about six years. They had two practitioners and a loyal patient base built through referrals. Their website was professionally designed but had almost no organic search visibility because the content was thin and the site structure did not target the specific treatment searches their potential patients were making. Over about eight months we rebuilt the content architecture with individual treatment pages, created detailed content around each procedure, optimised the Google Business Profile and built links from medical and beauty directories. The clinic started receiving a steady flow of new patient enquiries through organic search.</p>

<p>For retail businesses in Double Bay, the search approach depends on whether the business sells online. For retail with e-commerce, product page and category page optimisation are the primary focus. For bricks-and-mortar retail, Google Business Profile and local search visibility are more impactful.</p>
