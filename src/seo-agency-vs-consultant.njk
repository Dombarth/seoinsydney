        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>The Basic Difference</h2>
            <p>An SEO agency is a company with multiple staff members. You typically work with an account manager who coordinates work among specialists. There might be separate people for technical SEO, content, and link building.</p>
            
            <p>An SEO consultant is usually one person. You work directly with them. They do the work themselves or coordinate with your team for implementation.</p>
            
            <p>This difference affects pricing, communication, capacity, and the overall experience.</p>

<!-- Pricing Comparison Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Pricing Comparison</h2>
            <p>Agency pricing in Sydney typically starts around $2,000 to $3,000 per month for small campaigns. Larger campaigns can run $5,000 to $10,000+ monthly. The overhead of running an agency is reflected in these prices.</p>
            
            <p>Consultant pricing typically starts around $1,000 to $2,000 per month. The same work often costs less because there's less overhead. But consultants can only handle a limited number of clients.</p>
            
            <p>Higher agency prices don't necessarily mean better results. Sometimes you're paying for the account management layer rather than additional SEO work. Sometimes the agency model provides value you can't get from a consultant. It depends on what you need.</p>

<!-- My Position Section -->

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>My Position</h2>
            <p>I'm a consultant. I work directly with clients, do the work myself, and charge less than agencies because I have less overhead. That's the model I've chosen because I believe it serves most small to medium businesses better.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm not the right fit for everyone. If you need a large team executing multiple workstreams, or you prefer having an account manager, an agency might be better for you. I'll tell you that honestly if it's the case.</p>
            
            <p>If you're not sure which approach fits your situation, I'm happy to discuss it. No sales pitch, just help you figure out what makes sense for your business.</p>
