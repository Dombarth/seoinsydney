faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For galleries, fashion boutiques, and professional services along Oxford Street, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2021 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches, with higher competition in fashion retail and art gallery categories. Businesses with established Google Business Profiles typically see faster initial improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the eastern suburbs including Bondi Junction, Surry Hills, Double Bay, Woollahra, Darlinghurst, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "I was sceptical about SEO because we had tried it before with another provider and saw nothing. This time the approach was different and the results started showing within three months."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an eastern suburbs precinct within the 2021 postcode, centred on Oxford Street between the CBD and Bondi Junction. The suburb is known for its Victorian terrace architecture, art galleries, fashion boutiques, and the local markets held every Saturday at the area Uniting Church on Oxford Street. Five Ways, the intersection of Glenmore Road, Heeley Street, Goodhope Street, and Broughton Street, is the secondary commercial node in the suburb, with a cluster of cafes, restaurants, and independent retail.</p>

<p>The area's commercial identity is built around fashion, art, and design. The density of galleries along Oxford Street, combined with boutique fashion retailers, creates a niche commercial environment where search visibility can directly drive foot traffic and enquiries. Beyond the creative sector, the area has a concentration of health practitioners, legal and financial services, and hospitality venues that serve the local residential population and the broader eastern suburbs. A structured local SEO campaign helps these businesses capture search demand from residents, visitors, and the Saturday markets crowd.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive categories along Oxford Street or Five Ways, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>
