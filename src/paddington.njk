<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Paddington across the areas of interior design, fashion retail, galleries, professional services and hospitality. Paddington has a specific type of business owner — typically creative, design conscious and protective of their brand. That suits how we work because we don't do anything templated or rushed.</p>

<p>Oxford Street from the Woollahra end through to Glenmore Road is still the main commercial strip. It has changed a lot over the years but the businesses that remain are usually well established and highly regarded in their field. William Street and Elizabeth Street also have a solid cluster of design firms, architects and boutique agencies.</p>

<p>We worked with an interior design studio on William Street for about two and a half years. They had an excellent portfolio and strong reputation through referrals but their website generated almost zero enquiries from organic search. The content was visually beautiful but had no structure for search engines to understand what services they offered or where they operated. We reworked the site architecture, built service pages around their key offerings like residential renovation and commercial fitout and created suburb specific landing pages for the eastern suburbs areas they worked in most. Within about seven months they were appearing in search results for interior design terms across Paddington, Woollahra, Double Bay and Darlinghurst. Their organic enquiries went from roughly one per quarter to four or five per month.</p>

<p>The competition in this area tends to come from two directions. You've got the well established Paddington businesses that have been around for decades and have strong domain authority from years of backlinks and press coverage. Then you've got newer businesses targeting the same searches from surrounding suburbs like Surry Hills and Woollahra. Both are beatable with the right approach but it takes time and consistency.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. No lock in contracts. Written quote before anything starts.</p>
