<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Paddington and across the eastern suburbs. We've been working with businesses along Oxford Street, Glenmore Road, William Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Paddington has retained its boutique village character despite the changes happening further along Oxford Street towards the city.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Paddington is known for its art galleries, fashion boutiques, designer homewares, high end dining and a strong community of creative professionals. Theres also a growing number of medical and wellness practitioners particularly along Oxford Street and the side streets. For businesses in Paddington the customer base is affluent and discerning which means they research thoroughly before purchasing. Its a suburb where having strong organic visibility matters because the type of customer looking for services in Paddington will check your website and reviews before making contact.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a contemporary art gallery near Glenmore Road in mid 2020 that had been operating for about ten years. They represented about fifteen Australian artists and had a loyal collector base but their website was essentially a portfolio with no searchable content which is where most of their online visibility problems came from. We rebuilt the site with individual artist pages, exhibition archive pages, content around collecting and art investment topics and built links from arts publications and cultural directories. Over about nine months their organic traffic from art related searches increased significantly and they started receiving enquiries from collectors outside their existing network. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the arts and culture content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't have experience with.</p>

<p>The Saturday Paddington Markets bring significant foot traffic but the boutiques and galleries along Oxford Street need weekday visitors too. A Paddington business that invests in local SEO can build consistent visibility for the searches that happen throughout the week when people are planning their weekend shopping or researching specific items.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Paddington businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For galleries, boutique retail and professional services in Paddington its usually between $1,400 and $2,000 depending on how broad the targeting is. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Paddington business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Paddington area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
