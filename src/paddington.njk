faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Paddington business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Paddington businesses start from $1,200 per month. For fashion, gallery and boutique businesses targeting broader Sydney or national searches, it typically sits between $1,500 and $2,000."
  - q: "Is SEO relevant for fashion and gallery businesses in Paddington?"
    a: "Fashion retailers, galleries and design boutiques in Paddington can benefit from both local SEO and broader organic search visibility. Many businesses in this category rely heavily on foot traffic and Instagram but have not invested in organic search, which means there is often less competition for relevant product and service terms than expected."
  - q: "How does Paddington's search landscape differ from nearby suburbs?"
    a: "Paddington has a distinct commercial identity focused on fashion, art, design and premium services. The competition is concentrated in these niche categories rather than the broad hospitality competition found in suburbs like Surry Hills or Newtown. This niche focus can make SEO more efficient because the target audience is well-defined."
  - q: "Do you work with health practitioners in Paddington?"
    a: "Yes. Paddington has a number of medical and allied health practices, particularly along Oxford Street. For these businesses, service-specific pages and Google Business Profile optimisation are the highest-impact activities."

<h2>The Search Landscape in Paddington</h2>

<p>Paddington's commercial character is defined by its fashion retailers, galleries, antique dealers, design boutiques and premium professional services. The suburb sits between Surry Hills and the eastern suburbs, with Oxford Street running through its centre. The business mix creates a different search profile from the hospitality-dominated strips found in neighbouring suburbs.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Paddington:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fashion and design retail competing for product and brand-adjacent searches</li>
    <li>Art galleries with both local and national audience targeting</li>
    <li>Premium health and medical practices serving the eastern suburbs</li>
    <li>Professional services firms in heritage terrace office spaces</li>
    <li>Many businesses relying on foot traffic and social media without organic search investment</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Paddington</h2>

<p>We worked with a boutique fashion retailer on Oxford Street that had been trading for about eight years. They had a strong Instagram following but their website was primarily an e-commerce platform with minimal SEO consideration. Product descriptions were thin, category pages lacked proper content and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. Over about six months we restructured the category and product page architecture, added content that aligned with how their customers were searching, optimised the GBP and built links from fashion and lifestyle publications. The organic traffic to their website increased steadily and they started converting search visitors alongside their social media audience.</p>

<p>For health practitioners in Paddington, the approach is similar to other eastern suburbs locations. Service-specific pages, practitioner profiles and Google Business Profile optimisation with proper health categories are the foundation. The competition for health searches in the area is moderate, and consistent investment tends to produce results within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>

    <li>Link building from relevant fashion, health and local sources</li>
