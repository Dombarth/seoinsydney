<h2>How We Work in Brookvale</h2>

<p>We worked with a commercial plumbing business in the Brookvale industrial area that had been operating for about eight years. They served commercial clients across the Northern Beaches and North Shore but relied entirely on referrals and repeat business. Their website was a single page with contact details. Over about five months we built a proper site with pages for each commercial plumbing service, optimised their Google Business Profile with service areas covering their operating region, and built citations across trade directories. They started receiving consistent enquiries from businesses that found them through search.</p>
