<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Brookvale and across the northern beaches. We've been working with businesses around Pittwater Road, Old Pittwater Road, Harbord Road, Cross Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Brookvale has always been the commercial and industrial backbone of the northern beaches with a mix of businesses you don't find in the beachside suburbs.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Brookvale is the light industrial and commercial hub of the northern beaches. Theres a strong concentration of trade businesses, automotive services, fitness centres, breweries, warehousing operations, wholesalers and an increasing number of food and hospitality venues. The Warringah Mall precinct adds a major retail component. For businesses in Brookvale the search opportunity is often in the trade and service categories where theres strong demand from the entire northern beaches population. Its a suburb where businesses that service a wide area can benefit enormously from local SEO because Brookvale is the natural centre that people across the beaches search around.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a fitness gym near Old Pittwater Road in mid 2022 that had been operating for about three years. They offered strength training, group fitness and personal training. They were getting most of their members from Instagram and referrals which is where most of their sign ups had always come from. Their website was a Wix template with a timetable and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. We rebuilt the site with pages for each training style, created content around fitness goals and training methodologies, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and class information and built links from fitness directories and health publications. Over about six months their new member enquiries from organic search went from about two per week to around nine. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the fitness content which a lot of other agencies on the northern beaches outsource.</p>

<p>The brewery and craft beverage scene in Brookvale has grown significantly with several breweries and distilleries now operating in the industrial area. Most rely on social media and events. A brewery in Brookvale that invests in local SEO can capture the planning searches from people across Sydney who are looking for a northern beaches brewery experience on the weekend.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Brookvale businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For fitness businesses and trade services in Brookvale its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services and areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Brookvale business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Brookvale area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
