  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For automotive, trade, and retail businesses in the local industrial precinct, campaigns usually sit between $1,200 and $1,500. The price depends on the level of competition and the number of keywords. A written quotation is given before the execution of the work."
  - q: "How long does it take to see SEO results?"
    a: "Local businesses normally see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2100 postcode has moderate competition for trade and industrial service categories. Those businesses who focus on niche trade or B2B keywords can expect to see their results faster."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Absolutely. I team up with Northern Beaches companies in Dee Why, Manly, Freshwater, Curl Curl and even all Sydney metropolitan area suburbs. The method is customised to the unique search environment of the place."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns operate on a month-to-month basis with a 30-day notice. It is advisable to have a minimum 6-month period as SEO results have a compounding effect over time, but there is no lock-in contract of any sort. If you stop, all your assets remain with you."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>Brookvale is an industrial and commercial suburb in the Northern Beaches 2100 postcode, not a residential centre. The industrial area around Old Pittwater Road, Cross Street, and Winbourne Road is home to one of the largest concentrations of trade, automotive services, breweries, and light industrial businesses on the Northern Beaches.</p>

<p>On the eastern border of Brookvale is Warringah Mall, one of the largest shopping centres in the region. The Manly Warringah Sea Eagles home ground at 4 Pines Park (formerly Brookvale Oval) is a local icon.</p>

<p>The commercial makeup of the suburb is quite different from the neighbouring residential areas. The industrial area alone generates search demand for trade, automotive, building supplies, and other business services that cover the whole Northern Beaches region. Warringah Mall is a separate retail and consumer services search demand generator, compared with the industrial area.</p>

<p>For businesses within the local industrial precinct, local SEO features enquiries by first-time customers across the whole Northern Beaches, as many residents looking for trade and specialist services discover industrial area businesses. The brewery and craft beer area that has sprung up over the last few years is also a source of food and drink tourism search demand.</p>

<h2>Pricing and Structure</h2>

<p>We offer local SEO campaigns for local business ranging from $1,200 monthly. Before work starts, a written quotation with the full breakdown is handed.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. You keep everything if you decide to leave. I personally handle every campaign without passing it on to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>

<h2>What Our SEO Campaigns Cover</h2>

<h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
<p>I evaluate your GBP listing, adjust the categories correctly, and add relevant attributes. I also do posts, and the Q and A section. The majority of businesses I come across have their GBP listing either wrong or not at all.</p>

<h3>Local Citation Building</h3>
<p>Your business name, address, and phone number must be consistent everywhere. I correct discrepancies among Australian directories and build genuine citations that bring benefits to local ranking.</p>

<h3>On-Page and Technical SEO</h3>
<p>Site speed, crawling issues, internal linking, schema markup, Core Web Vitals. The little helpers no one wants to hear about but when the moment comes, they do the job.</p>

<h3>Content and Keyword Strategy</h3>
<p>Keyword scouting for your suburb and service area. Page optimisation. Content planning is based on actual Google queries instead of what you assume people look for.</p>

            <h3>Audit and Research</h3>
            <p>I check your website, your Google Business Profile, your citations, and your competitors activities in this locality. An average audit usually takes around three days. The result is a written document with the findings, not the sales pitch.</p>

            <h3>Strategy and Implementation</h3>
            <p>I create a marketing plan based on keywords and local signals that will generate results. After that, I perform the technical fixes, content creation, and citation building. You negotiate with me only. I do not give assignments to junior staff.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Reporting and Iteration</h3>
            <p>Every month you receive a written report that covers rankings, traffic and leads. Not a dashboard with charts and no explanations. A real report which explains what has happened and what I am going to do next. Most of my clients continue to stay for years because they can see what is being done.</p>
