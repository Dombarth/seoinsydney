<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Brookvale across the areas of trades, manufacturing, automotive, fitness and retail. Brookvale is the industrial and commercial engine of the northern beaches. The area along Pittwater Road, Old Pittwater Road and the surrounding industrial streets houses everything from breweries and gyms to panel beaters and wholesale distributors.</p>

<p>The business mix in Brookvale is different to most Sydney suburbs. Its less about white collar services and more about physical businesses — trades, automotive, fitness, food production, brewing. These businesses often have strong local reputations but limited online visibility because their owners are busy running the actual business and haven't prioritised their websites or Google presence.</p>

<p>We worked with a CrossFit gym on one of the industrial streets off Sydenham Road. They'd been operating for about four years and had built a community of about 120 members primarily through word of mouth and Instagram. But their growth had plateaued and they weren't attracting new members from search. The website was a single page with class times and a sign up form. We built a proper website with pages for their different programs — CrossFit classes, personal training, nutrition coaching, Olympic lifting — optimised the GBP and built links from fitness directories and northern beaches community sites. Within about four months they were showing in search results for gym and CrossFit searches across Brookvale, Dee Why, Manly and Curl Curl. They brought in about 25 new members over the following three months directly from organic search and Google Maps enquiries.</p>

<p>For the trades and automotive businesses in the Brookvale industrial area SEO is often the difference between getting calls from the entire northern beaches versus just the people who already know you. Most of these businesses have never done any SEO which means the opportunity is significant.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
