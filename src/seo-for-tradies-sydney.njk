        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How People Find Tradies Online</h2>
            <p>When something breaks or needs doing, people search Google. "Plumber near me", "electrician Parramatta", "emergency locksmith Sydney". The tradies who appear in those results get the calls.</p>
            
            <p>Word of mouth still matters, but even referrals Google you first to check reviews and make sure you're legit. Your online presence affects whether they call you or someone else.</p>
            
            <p>Trade SEO is about appearing when people in your service area search for what you do. Not fancy marketing, just being visible when someone needs a job done.</p>
            
            <p>This is part of my broader <a href="/seo-services-sydney/">SEO services</a> for Sydney businesses. For trades specifically, <a href="/local-seo/">local SEO</a> is usually the most important piece because you're targeting customers in specific geographic areas.</p>

<!-- What Trade SEO Includes Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Trade SEO Includes</h2>
            
            <h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
            <p>This is the big one for tradies. Your Google listing is what appears in Maps and local search results. I set it up properly, optimise it for your services and areas, and help you get reviews. For many trades, this alone brings in consistent leads.</p>
            
            <h3>Service Area Pages</h3>
            <p>If you work across multiple suburbs, you want to appear for searches in each area. A plumber working the inner west might have pages for Balmain, Leichhardt, Annandale. These don't need to be long, just clear about what you do and where you do it.</p>
            
            <h3>Service Pages</h3>
            <p>People search for specific problems. "Blocked drain plumber", "hot water system installation", "switchboard upgrade". Pages for each main service capture these searches and show you know what you're doing.</p>
            
            <h3>Reviews</h3>
            <p>Reviews affect your local ranking and whether people choose you. I help you get more reviews and respond to them professionally. Even a simple "thanks for the review" shows you're active and engaged.</p>
            
            <h3>Simple Website</h3>
            <p>If you don't have a website, or the one you have is embarrassing, I can help. A simple site with your services, areas, and contact details is enough. Doesn't need to be fancy, just needs to work and show up in searches.</p>

            <h2>Trades I Work With</h2>
            <p>SEO works for any trade where customers search online. I've worked with:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Plumbers:</strong> Emergency, general, hot water, blocked drains</li>
                <li><strong>Electricians:</strong> Residential, commercial, emergency, solar</li>
                <li><strong>Builders and Carpenters:</strong> New builds, renovations, decks</li>
                <li><strong>Painters:</strong> Interior, exterior, commercial</li>
                <li><strong>Landscapers:</strong> Design, construction, maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Locksmiths:</strong> Emergency, residential, commercial</li>
                <li><strong>Concreters:</strong> Driveways, patios, foundations</li>
                <li><strong>Air Conditioning:</strong> Installation, service, repair</li>
                <li><strong>Roofers:</strong> Repairs, replacement, guttering</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each trade has different search patterns and competition. I research what's actually being searched in your trade and area, then build around that.</p>

<!-- Pricing Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Trade SEO Pricing</h2>
            <p>SEO for sole traders and small trade businesses starts from $1,000 per month. I keep pricing realistic because I know trade businesses don't have corporate marketing budgets.</p>
            
            <p>What you get for that:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Google Business Profile optimisation and management</li>
                <li>Local SEO for your service areas</li>
                <li>Service page creation or improvement</li>
                <li>Review strategy</li>
                <li>Monthly reporting</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Larger operations with multiple locations or services may need more. I'll tell you honestly what you need and what it costs before starting.</p>
            
            <p>No lock-in contracts. Month-to-month. You stay because you're getting calls, not because you're locked in.</p>
