<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner south suburb within the 2018 postcode, positioned between Alexandria and Mascot. The suburb has a mix of older residential streets with Federation and inter-war housing, and newer high-density apartment developments that are part of the broader Green Square urban renewal. The Cannery on Rothschild Avenue is a dining and retail destination in a converted industrial building, and Gardeners Road is the main commercial corridor with a mix of retail, trade showrooms, and service businesses. The suburb's central position in the inner south makes it accessible to residents of surrounding suburbs.</p>

<p>The mix of established and new residential stock here creates diverse search demand. The older housing generates trades and renovation search activity, while the new apartments drive demand for contemporary services including fitness, health practitioners, dining, and convenience businesses. The commercial activity along Gardeners Road and in the converted industrial spaces generates search demand for specialist retail, dining, and creative services. For businesses here, local SEO captures enquiries from both the established residential community and the growing apartment population, with search demand increasing as the Green Square area continues to develop.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>The Cannery precinct and Gardeners Road generate the primary commercial search demand here. Dining and specialty retail searches target these commercial areas, with the Cannery functioning as a destination that draws searches from across the inner south. Google Business Profile quality, photo content, and review management are important for hospitality businesses in the area.</p>

<p>Health and professional services target the local residential catchment. Dental practices, GPs, and allied health professionals serve the growing population, while trades businesses target both the older housing stock for renovation work and the apartment buildings for maintenance services. The inner south position of the area means some searches overlap with Alexandria, Mascot, and Zetland, and businesses benefit from targeting the broader area rather than the area alone. The growing population density means search volume is increasing across most service categories.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
