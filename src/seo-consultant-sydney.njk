<!-- Why Work With a Consultant Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Work With an SEO Consultant</h2>
            <p>Agencies have their place. If you need a large team executing multiple workstreams simultaneously, an agency makes sense. But for most Sydney businesses, a consultant is the better fit.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what working with me looks like compared to a typical agency:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Direct access:</strong> You talk to the person doing the work. Not an account manager who passes messages to a team.</li>
                <li><strong>No outsourcing:</strong> I don't send work offshore. Content is written locally. Link building is done manually. Technical work is handled directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower overhead:</strong> Agencies have offices, staff, and sales teams to pay for. Consultants have lower costs and that's reflected in pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The person who does your audit does your implementation does your reporting. No handoffs between different team members.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> I can pivot quickly. If something isn't working, we change approach. No internal approvals or resource allocation meetings.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The trade-off is capacity. I can only work with a limited number of clients at once. If you need massive scale, an agency is the better choice. If you want someone who knows your business and works on it directly, a consultant is the way to go.</p>

<!-- What I Do Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What I Do as Your SEO Consultant</h2>
            <p>SEO consulting covers everything that affects your search visibility. The specific mix depends on what your site needs most.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
            <p>Site speed, crawl issues, mobile usability, schema markup, and technical problems that prevent ranking. I identify what's broken and fix it. Technical SEO is often the quickest win for sites that have decent content but poor performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
            <p>What pages do you need? What should they say? How do they target search intent? I work out what your potential customers are actually searching for, then create or improve pages to match those searches. Content that ranks and converts.</p>
            
            <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
            <p>Not just obvious terms. The long-tail phrases that often convert better. The questions people ask Google. The terms your competitors are missing. I use a mix of tools and manual analysis to find opportunities.</p>
            
            <h3>Link Building</h3>
            <p>Links from other sites tell Google your site is worth ranking. I build links through content outreach, local business connections, and industry relationships. Actual links from real sites, not directories or spam.</p>
            
            <h3>Local SEO</h3>
            <p>For businesses serving specific geographic areas. Google Business Profile optimisation, local citations, review management, and location-based content. Essential for retail, trades, health services, and any business where customers search with location intent.</p>

<!-- How Consulting Works Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How SEO Consulting Works</h2>
            
            <h3>Initial Audit</h3>
            <p>Everything starts with understanding where you are. I look at your current rankings, technical setup, content, backlink profile, and competitors. This tells me what's working, what's not, and where the opportunities are.</p>
            
            <h3>Strategy Development</h3>
            <p>Based on the audit, I work out what's going to move the needle fastest for your specific situation. Some sites need technical fixes first. Others need content. Others need links. The strategy is built around your site, not a template.</p>
            
            <h3>Monthly Implementation</h3>
            <p>Each month I pick the highest-impact tasks, do them, track results, and adjust. You get a report showing what was done and what moved. If something isn't working I'll say so and we'll try something else.</p>
            
            <h3>Ongoing Communication</h3>
            <p>You can reach me directly. Questions get answered by the person doing the work. No waiting for account managers to get back to you or wondering if your message was passed along.</p>

<!-- Who I Work With Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
            <p>SEO consulting works best for businesses that want direct access to the person doing the work. I typically work with:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Small to medium businesses:</strong> Companies that need SEO but don't need a full agency team</li>
                <li><strong>Service businesses:</strong> Lawyers, accountants, consultants, trades, health professionals</li>
                <li><strong>Local businesses:</strong> Retail, hospitality, and services targeting specific Sydney areas</li>
                <li><strong>Ecommerce stores:</strong> Online retailers needing product and category page optimisation</li>
                <li><strong>Business owners who want to understand SEO:</strong> People who want to know what's being done and why, not just receive a monthly report</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I don't work with everyone. If you need massive scale, want to hand everything off and never think about it, or are looking for the cheapest option, I'm probably not the right fit. But if you want someone who will learn your business and work on it directly, let's talk.</p>
