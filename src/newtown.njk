faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues or retail businesses on King Street competing in a saturated market, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,000. Pricing depends on competition level and the scope of keywords being targeted. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2042 postcode has moderate to high competition for hospitality and retail search terms due to the density of businesses along King Street. For service businesses in less saturated categories, results can come faster, particularly through Google Business Profile optimisation."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner west including Marrickville, Enmore, Erskineville, Camperdown, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is centred on King Street, one of the longest continuous shopping strips in Australia, running from the area railway station through to St Peters in the 2042 postcode. The suburb borders Enmore to the west, Erskineville to the south, and Camperdown to the north. The area has a distinct identity as a creative, independent, and culturally diverse area with a high density of restaurants, cafes, bars, vintage shops, tattoo studios, and independent retail businesses. The area also contains a growing number of health practitioners, professional services firms, and trades businesses serving the inner west.</p>

<p>Search competition here is high for hospitality and dining terms due to the sheer number of venues along King Street and Enmore Road. For businesses outside the hospitality sector, competition is more moderate, and local SEO provides a clear path to visibility in a market where many businesses rely on foot traffic and word of mouth rather than search. Businesses that rank for the area-specific search terms capture enquiries from the large residential population and the significant visitor traffic the area attracts.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues or businesses in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
