faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a Newtown business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for Newtown businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on-page work, Google Business Profile management, content, citation building and monthly reporting. Most Newtown businesses sit within the $1,200 to $1,800 range."
  - q: "Is SEO worth it for a restaurant or cafe on King Street?"
    a: "King Street has one of the highest concentrations of hospitality venues in Sydney. For restaurants and cafes, Google Business Profile optimisation is the most impactful SEO investment. Most venues on King Street have not optimised their GBP properly, which means basic local SEO can create meaningful separation."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO in Newtown?"
    a: "Newtown has a high density of businesses in a compact area, particularly along King Street and Enmore Road. For hospitality searches the competition is intense but shallow, meaning most businesses have not invested in SEO. For service businesses like health practitioners, tradespeople and creative agencies, the competition is moderate."
  - q: "Do you work with health practitioners in Newtown?"
    a: "Yes. We work with physiotherapists, psychologists, dentists and other health practitioners in Newtown. For these businesses, service-specific pages and Google Business Profile optimisation are typically the highest-impact activities."

<h2>The Search Landscape in Newtown</h2>

<p>Newtown's commercial activity is concentrated along King Street, one of the longest continuous shopping strips in Australia. The business mix includes restaurants, cafes, bars, vintage shops, health practitioners, tattoo studios, bookshops and a growing number of professional services firms in the side streets.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Newtown:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High hospitality density along King Street with intense competition for dining searches</li>
    <li>Diverse retail mix with both mainstream and niche businesses</li>
    <li>Growing number of health and wellness practitioners</li>
    <li>Creative businesses and studios in the surrounding streets</li>
    <li>Strong foot traffic driving Google Business Profile importance</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Newtown</h2>

<p>We worked with a dental practice off King Street that had been operating for about seven years. They had two dentists and a hygienist, and most of their patients came through referrals. Their website was a basic template with a single page listing all their services. Over about five months we rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages, optimised their Google Business Profile with proper categories and service descriptions, built citations across dental and health directories and started a modest content programme around common dental searches. The practice went from receiving almost no organic enquiries to getting a consistent flow each month.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses on King Street, the challenge is standing out among hundreds of venues. Google Business Profile optimisation is where the majority of the search value sits. Review management, photo quality, correct categories, menu uploads and regular posting all contribute. Most restaurants and cafes on King Street have a GBP but have not maintained it, which creates an opportunity for those that invest in it properly.</p>
