<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Newtown and across the inner west. We've been working with businesses along King Street, Enmore Road, Australia Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Newtown has always been one of our favourite suburbs to work in because the business owners here tend to actually care about doing things properly.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Newtown has one of the densest strips of independent businesses in Sydney. Theres hundreds of restaurants, cafes, bars, vintage shops, tattoo studios, wellness practitioners and creative businesses along King Street and Enmore Road. For businesses in Newtown the challenge is standing out in a market where your nearest competitor is literally next door. The food and dining searches are extremely competitive. Its a suburb where the businesses that invest in SEO tend to punch well above their weight because most of the competition is relying on foot traffic and Instagram.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a Thai restaurant just off King Street in early 2020 that had been running for about twelve years. Great food, loyal customer base but they were struggling with the delivery app commissions eating into their margins which is where most of their frustration came from. Their website was a basic one pager with a PDF menu and their Google Business Profile had wrong opening hours and no photos. We rebuilt the site with an online ordering page, created content around their cuisine style and ingredients, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and categories and built a few links from food blogs and local directories. Over about five months their direct orders through the website went from almost zero to about thirty per week. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house which a lot of other agencies around Newtown don't bother with for hospitality clients.</p>

<p>The wellness and alternative health scene in Newtown is another interesting market. Theres acupuncturists, naturopaths, massage therapists, yoga studios and meditation centres all within walking distance of each other. Most of them have basic websites and rely on word of mouth. A wellness practitioner in Newtown that invests in local SEO can build a consistent pipeline of new clients relatively quickly because the online competition is low compared to the number of people searching.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Newtown businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For hospitality businesses and health practitioners in Newtown its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many services or locations are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Newtown clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Newtown strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Newtown area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
