<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in search engine optimisation for businesses along King Street and the wider Newtown area. Newtown has always had its own character when it comes to the local business scene. King Street is one of the longest continuous strips of shops and restaurants in Sydney and the competition for foot traffic and online visibility is pretty intense.</p>

<p>The business mix here is mostly hospitality, retail and creative. Vintage clothing shops, record stores, tattoo studios, live music venues, Thai restaurants, cafes, pubs and an increasing number of health and wellness businesses. A lot of them are small independent operators who have never thought about SEO because they've relied on the street traffic and word of mouth.</p>

<p>We took on a Thai restaurant about halfway down King Street in 2021. They'd been there for over ten years and had a loyal customer base but they were losing ground to newer restaurants that had better Google visibility. Their website was a template with no real content, the Google Business Profile photos were from when they first opened and they weren't showing up in map results for Thai food in the area at all. We updated the website, rewrote the GBP description, added current photos, fixed about 20 inconsistent directory listings and built some links from local food blogs. About four months in they went from not appearing in the maps pack to consistently showing in the top three for Thai restaurant related searches in the inner west.</p>

<p>For the retail businesses on King Street the challenge is often competing against the online stores. A vintage clothing shop needs to show up when someone searches "vintage clothing Sydney" or "thrift shop near me" and most of them don't have a website that Google can index properly. Even a basic website with a few pages of content can make a significant difference.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No setup fees, no lock in contracts, month to month.</p>

<p>All work done in house by our Sydney based team. No offshore outsourcing.</p>
