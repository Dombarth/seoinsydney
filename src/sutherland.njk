<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Sutherland and the surrounding suburbs of Jannali, Kirrawee and Gymea. Sutherland is an important commercial hub in the Shire. The area around the Sutherland Entertainment Centre, Flora Street, Belmont Street and the streets near the station supports a solid mix of professional services, medical practices, trades businesses and retail shops.</p>

<p>The professional services market in Sutherland is well established. Accountants, lawyers, financial planners and mortgage brokers all serve the Shire population from offices around the town centre. Many of these businesses have been operating for years on referrals and haven't needed to think about search visibility. But as younger clients increasingly research and compare services online the businesses without a strong search presence are losing opportunities to competitors who have one.</p>

<p>We started working with an accounting firm on Flora Street in early 2023. They had three partners and about ten staff serving mostly small business and individual tax clients in the Shire. Their website was a professional looking template site but had no SEO structure — no service pages, no location relevance, generic content. We rebuilt the website around their specific service offerings — small business accounting, tax planning, SMSF, BAS and payroll, business advisory — and created content targeting the searches their potential clients were actually making. We optimised the GBP and built links from accounting associations and local business directories. Within about seven months they were ranking for most accounting related searches in the Sutherland Shire. Their new client enquiries from organic search went from essentially none to about eight per month. The managing partner told us they'd been thinking about SEO for years but kept putting it off, and wished they'd started sooner.</p>

<p>For the trades businesses based in Sutherland — plumbers, electricians, builders — the Shire market is large enough to sustain a full client base without needing to travel far. Local SEO captures that market efficiently.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
