<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Caringbah and across the Sutherland Shire. We've been working with businesses around Kingsway, Port Hacking Road, Taren Point Road and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Caringbah has maintained its position as a key commercial area in the central Shire with a strong mix of retail, automotive and service businesses.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Caringbah has a diverse business community with a notable concentration of automotive dealerships and service centres along Taren Point Road, alongside medical practices, dental clinics, restaurants, retail shops and trade businesses. For businesses in Caringbah the customer base draws from the surrounding suburbs including Woolooware, Taren Point, Dolans Bay and Lilli Pilli. Its a suburb where local SEO can have a strong impact because businesses here serve a defined geographic catchment and the search behaviour is very local and specific.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an automotive service centre near Taren Point Road in late 2021 that had been operating for about nine years. Three mechanics handling general servicing, logbook maintenance and pre purchase inspections. They were getting most of their work from repeat customers and word of mouth which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was a basic GoDaddy template and they didn't have a Google Business Profile. We built a proper site with individual service pages, sorted out the GBP with photos and proper categories, created content around common car servicing questions and built citations across automotive directories. Over about six months their new customer enquiries from organic search went from almost nothing to about eight per week. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the automotive content which a lot of other agencies in the Shire don't write properly.</p>

<p>The medical and dental market in Caringbah serves the central Shire population. Practices here compete with Miranda and Cronulla for patients but many residents prefer a local practitioner they can walk to. A medical or dental practice in Caringbah that invests in local SEO can capture the nearby patient searches that would otherwise default to the larger centres.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Caringbah businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For automotive and trade businesses in Caringbah its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services and areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Caringbah business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Caringbah area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
