<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Caringbah and the surrounding areas of Taren Point, Dolans Bay and Lilli Pilli. Caringbah is a well established commercial centre in the Sutherland Shire. The area along Kingsway, Port Hacking Road and around the Caringbah shopping village supports a range of local businesses including automotive services, retail, hospitality, trades and professional services.</p>

<p>The automotive and mechanical repair market along Kingsway and the Taren Point industrial area is one of the strongest in the Shire. Theres a high concentration of mechanics, tyre shops, auto electricians and specialist repairers all serving the car dependent Shire population. Most of these businesses have been around for years and rely on repeat customers and word of mouth. But the ones that have invested in even basic SEO are picking up new customers that their competitors are missing.</p>

<p>We worked with an auto electrician on Taren Point Road who had been in business for over twenty years. He was one of the most experienced auto electricians in the Shire but had never bothered with a website. He had a GBP that someone had set up years ago and that was it. His main competitor had a decent website and was ranking for every auto electrical search in the area. We built him a straightforward website with pages for his key services — car electrical repairs, alternator and starter motor repairs, air conditioning, lighting upgrades, caravan and boat electrics — optimised the GBP and got reviews flowing. Within about three months he was sharing the map pack with his competitor and within six months had overtaken them for several terms. He said the phone calls from new customers increased noticeably and he was getting jobs from Engadine and Sutherland that he wouldn't have previously.</p>

<p>For the retail and hospitality businesses in the Caringbah shopping village local SEO and GBP management are the foundations. Most local searches in this area lead to the map pack.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
