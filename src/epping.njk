  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"

  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner north and upper north shore including Macquarie Park, Eastwood, Carlingford, Ryde, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."

    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner north suburb within the 2121 postcode, positioned at the junction of the Northern and Sydney Metro Northwest rail lines. The local station is a major transport interchange connecting the T1 Northern line to Chatswood with the Metro Northwest line to Tallawong via Macquarie Park. The commercial area along Rawson Street, Beecroft Road, and Oxford Street contains a mix of retail shops, restaurants, health practices, and professional services offices. High-density apartment development around the station precinct has reshaped the suburb's population composition over the past decade.</p>

<p>The area's transport accessibility and growing residential density make it a strong local search market. The suburb draws from a catchment that includes Eastwood, Carlingford, North the area, and Cheltenham. New apartment residents searching for local services, health practitioners, and dining options create growing search demand that did not exist before the Metro line opened. For businesses that have operated in the area commercial strip for years, local SEO provides a way to capture this new demand and maintain visibility as the competitive landscape shifts with new businesses opening in the station precinct.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
