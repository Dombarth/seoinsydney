<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Epping and the surrounding suburbs of North Epping, Carlingford and Beecroft. Epping is a well established suburban centre that straddles the boundary between the north shore and the Hills District. The area around Rawson Street, Oxford Street, the Epping station precinct and the nearby commercial areas supports a range of businesses including medical practices, education services, retail and hospitality.</p>

<p>The education and tutoring market in Epping is significant. The suburb has a strong academic culture with families who invest heavily in their children's education. Tutoring centres, coaching colleges and private tutors all serve this market. The competition is fierce — there are probably 15 to 20 tutoring businesses within a few kilometres of Epping station. The ones that rank well in Google capture families searching for specific subject help, exam preparation and academic programs.</p>

<p>We worked with a small coaching college on Rawson Street that had been operating for about four years. They offered selective school preparation, HSC coaching and general tutoring for primary and high school students. They had a decent student base from local referrals but were struggling to grow. Their website was basic and they had no GBP set up. We built a website with pages for each program and subject area, created content targeting the specific searches parents make — selective school test preparation, year 12 chemistry tutoring, maths coaching near me — set up and optimised the GBP and built links from education directories. Within about five months they were appearing in search results for tutoring and coaching searches across Epping, Eastwood, Carlingford and Marsfield. Their enrolment enquiries increased significantly — the owner told us they had to cap class sizes and start a waitlist for their selective school program.</p>

<p>For the medical practices and professional services firms in the Epping station precinct the ongoing development around the station is bringing more foot traffic and search activity to the area.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
