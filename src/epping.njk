<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Epping and across the northern districts. We've been working with businesses around Rawson Street, Beecroft Road, Oxford Street, Bridge Street and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Epping has changed significantly with the metro line and the apartment developments around the station transforming the commercial landscape.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Epping is a well established residential suburb that has grown rapidly with the apartment developments. Theres a strong concentration of medical practices, dental clinics, tutoring centres, real estate agencies, restaurants and professional services firms along the main commercial strips. The population has increased substantially and the business community has expanded to match. For businesses in Epping the customer base includes both long term residents and the growing apartment population which creates demand across a range of local services. Its a suburb where local SEO works well because the residents search for services in their area rather than travelling to larger centres.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a tutoring centre near Rawson Street in early 2022 that had been running for about five years. They offered maths, English and science tutoring for primary and high school students with a focus on selective school and scholarship preparation. They were getting most of their enrolments from parent referrals and school networks which is where most of their students had always come from. Their website was a basic template with pricing and their Google Business Profile was minimal. We rebuilt the site with individual subject and program pages, created content around selective school test preparation and study tips, sorted out the GBP and built links from education directories. Over about seven months their organic enrolment enquiries went from about two per month to around nine. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the education content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The restaurant market in Epping has grown with the new population. Theres an increasing number of dining options around the station and along Rawson Street. A restaurant in Epping that invests in local SEO and GBP management can capture the searches from both the residential population and the commuters passing through the transport interchange.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Epping businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For education providers and medical practices in Epping its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many subjects or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Epping business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Epping area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
