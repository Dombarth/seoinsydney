<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner north suburb within the 2111 postcode, positioned along Victoria Road between Ryde and the inner west. The area commercial strip runs along Victoria Road and Cowell Street, with a concentration of retail shops, medical practices, restaurants, and trade businesses. The area Bridge connects the suburb to Drummoyne and the inner west, and Victoria Road carries heavy traffic between the CBD and western Sydney. The suburb has an established residential population with a mix of freestanding houses and older apartment buildings, plus proximity to the waterfront areas of Hunters Hill and Putney.</p>

<p>The area's Victoria Road position gives its businesses exposure to passing traffic, but online search behaviour is shifting attention away from drive-by discovery toward intentional search. Residents of Hunters Hill, Putney, Tennyson Point, and surrounding areas use local search to find services here, often searching for category-specific terms rather than browsing the shopping strip. For trade businesses, health practitioners, and professional services operating from the area, local SEO captures demand from a catchment that extends across the municipality of Hunters Hill and the western edge of Lane Cove, where limited commercial options push search queries toward the area as the nearest service centre.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
