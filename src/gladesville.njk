<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Gladesville and the surrounding suburbs of Hunters Hill, Tennyson Point and Putney. Gladesville is a well established suburban centre with a strong commercial strip along Victoria Road and the surrounding streets. The businesses here serve a mix of local residents and pass through traffic from one of Sydney's busiest arterial roads.</p>

<p>The Victoria Road commercial strip supports a range of businesses including medical centres, dental practices, automotive services, cafes, restaurants, beauty salons and professional services. The high traffic volume on Victoria Road means businesses here have visibility to a large number of potential customers but converting that awareness into actual customers requires being findable when those people search later from home.</p>

<p>We started working with a beauty salon on Victoria Road in mid 2022. They'd been operating for about seven years and had built a loyal client base from the local area. But they weren't attracting new clients at the rate they needed to grow. Their website was a basic site built on Wix with generic beauty industry content. The GBP had been claimed but was incomplete. We rebuilt the website with individual service pages for their key treatments — facials, microdermabrasion, laser hair removal, body treatments, lash and brow services — optimised the GBP with proper categories, service descriptions and regular photo updates. We cleaned up directory listings and built a few links from beauty and wellness directories. Within about five months they were ranking for beauty and facial searches across Gladesville, Hunters Hill, Ryde and Drummoyne. The owner told us new client bookings from search went from about two per week to eight or nine. She said it was the first marketing investment that had genuinely delivered a clear return.</p>

<p>For the automotive businesses along Victoria Road — mechanics, tyre shops, panel beaters — the passing traffic creates brand awareness but the actual bookings come from search. People drive past, note the business and then Google it later.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
