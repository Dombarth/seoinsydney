<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Chatswood and across the upper north shore. We've been working with businesses around Victoria Avenue, Archer Street, Albert Avenue, Railway Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Chatswood has grown into one of Sydneys busiest suburban centres with the Westfield expansion and the commercial tower development changing the scale of the area.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Chatswood is a major commercial and retail hub with a diverse business mix. Theres a strong presence of education providers, tutoring centres, medical specialists, real estate agencies, restaurants and professional services firms. The Asian dining and retail scene in Chatswood is particularly competitive. For businesses in Chatswood the challenge is standing out in a market where theres a lot of options within a compact area and the search behaviour splits between English and other language searches. Its a suburb where targeted local SEO campaigns can make a significant impact because the search volume is high.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a tutoring centre near Victoria Avenue in early 2021 that had been running for about six years. They offered maths and English tutoring for primary and high school students. They were getting most of their enrolments from parent referrals and school networks which is where most of their students had always come from. Their website was a basic template with pricing and a contact form and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. We rebuilt the site with individual subject and year level pages, created content around specific exam preparation topics like selective school tests and HSC subjects, sorted out the GBP and built links from education directories. Over about seven months their organic enrolment enquiries went from about three per month to around twelve. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the education content which a lot of other agencies in this area don't specialise in.</p>

<p>The restaurant market in Chatswood is one of the most competitive in Sydneys north. Theres hundreds of restaurants and food courts within walking distance of the station. Most rely on foot traffic and food review sites. A restaurant in Chatswood that invests in local SEO and GBP management can stand out in the map pack which is where most of the dining decision searches happen.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Chatswood businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For education providers and professional services firms in Chatswood its usually between $1,500 and $2,000 depending on how many subjects or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Chatswood clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Chatswood strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Chatswood area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
