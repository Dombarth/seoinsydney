  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services, retail businesses, and health practitioners in the local CBD, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $2,000. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2067 postcode has above-average competition for retail and professional service categories due to the concentration of commercial activity around Westfield and Victoria Avenue. Businesses with established websites and Google Business Profiles typically see faster improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the North Shore including St Leonards, Lane Cove, Willoughby, Artarmon, Roseville, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is the commercial centre of the upper North Shore within the 2067 postcode. Westfield and the Chase are the two anchor shopping centres, drawing shoppers from across the North Shore and beyond. Victoria Avenue is the main retail and dining strip, with a dense mix of restaurants, cafes, and specialty retail. The suburb has a large East Asian community, reflected in the dining options and specialty grocers along Victoria Avenue and the surrounding streets. The local station on the T1 North Shore Line and the new Sydney Metro line provides direct access to the CBD, North Sydney, and Macquarie Park.</p>

<p>The commercial density of the area creates higher search competition compared to surrounding residential North Shore suburbs. Retail businesses, restaurants, professional services, medical practices, and education providers all compete for visibility. The suburb functions as a regional commercial hub, meaning searches from Willoughby, Artarmon, Roseville, and other nearby suburbs often include the suburb as a location qualifier. A structured local SEO campaign here needs to address this competitive environment while capturing the broad catchment of searches that reference the suburb.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>Victoria Avenue and the surrounding commercial precinct generate the highest local search demand here. Restaurant and dining searches are a dominant category, with significant competition among Asian dining establishments. Google Business Profile quality, review volume, photo content, and accurate business information are critical for hospitality businesses competing for dining queries. The bilingual nature of many searches here also creates opportunities for businesses with multilingual content and Google Business Profile descriptions.</p>

<p>Professional services in the commercial office buildings along the Pacific Highway and Railway Street target both the area-specific queries and broader North Shore catchment searches. Medical and dental practices, accountants, lawyers, and financial advisers compete in categories where website authority and content depth drive rankings. The education and tutoring sector here is also significant, with multiple tutoring centres and education providers competing for parent-driven searches from the North Shore's education-focused demographic.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive categories around Westfield and Victoria Avenue, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
