<h2>The Search Landscape in Chatswood</h2>

<p>Chatswood functions as the primary commercial hub of the upper North Shore. The area has two major shopping centres, a significant concentration of professional services firms, medical and dental practices, and a diverse hospitality scene. The suburb's large Chinese-speaking population also shapes the search landscape with demand for bilingual and Chinese-language content.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Chatswood:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High retail competition alongside Westfield and Chatswood Chase tenants</li>
    <li>Strong concentration of medical, dental and specialist practices</li>
    <li>Professional services including accountants, lawyers and financial advisors</li>

<h2>How We Work in Chatswood</h2>

<p>We worked with a dental practice on Victoria Avenue that had three dentists and had been operating for about eight years. They had a steady patient base but were losing new patients to competitors who appeared more prominently in search results. Their website was a basic template with a single services page and their Google Business Profile had minimal detail. Over about six months we rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages, optimised the GBP with proper dental categories and detailed service descriptions, built citations across dental and health directories, and started a modest content programme. The practice moved into the local map pack for key dental searches and saw a measurable increase in new patient bookings.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses in Chatswood, the competition is diverse and spans multiple cuisine types. Google Business Profile optimisation is the primary lever, with review management, photo quality and correct category selection all contributing to visibility. The Chinese dining scene in particular has strong search demand from both English and Chinese-language queries.</p>
