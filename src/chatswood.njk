<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Chatswood and the surrounding lower north shore suburbs. Chatswood is one of Sydney's busiest commercial and retail centres. The area around Victoria Avenue, the Chatswood Chase and Westfield shopping centres and the streets along the Pacific Highway supports a massive number of businesses across education, medical, retail, hospitality and professional services.</p>

<p>The tutoring and education market in Chatswood is one of the most competitive in Australia. There are dozens of tutoring centres, coaching colleges and private tutors all targeting parents searching for academic support. The businesses that rank in Google get a disproportionate share of enquiries because parents in this area actively research online before committing.</p>

<p>We started working with a tutoring centre on Victoria Avenue in early 2023. They'd been operating for about three years and had a good reputation among their existing students but were struggling to attract new enrolments. Their website was a basic WordPress site with a couple of pages and their GBP had limited information. We rebuilt the site with individual pages for each subject area and year level, created content targeting the specific academic programs parents were searching for like selective school preparation and HSC subject coaching. We optimised the GBP, set up review generation and built links from education directories and parent community sites. Within about six months they were appearing in search results for their key tutoring terms across Chatswood, Willoughby, Artarmon and Lane Cove. Their monthly enrolment enquiries roughly doubled.</p>

<p>The medical and dental market in Chatswood is also extremely competitive. The concentration of practitioners around the Anderson Street and Help Street medical precincts means businesses here need a sustained SEO effort to break through. Short term campaigns won't cut it.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Education and medical industries typically $1,500 to $2,000. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts.</p>
