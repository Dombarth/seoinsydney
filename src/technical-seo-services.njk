<!-- What is Technical SEO Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Technical SEO Means</h2>
            <p>Technical SEO is everything that affects whether search engines can crawl, understand, and index your site properly. It's the foundation that content and links build on.</p>
            
            <p>A site with technical problems won't rank well regardless of how good the content is. Google can't rank pages it can't crawl. Pages that load slowly get demoted. Sites that don't work on mobile lose visibility. Technical SEO fixes these issues.</p>
            
            <p>Most Sydney business sites I audit have at least a few technical issues. Sometimes they're minor. Sometimes they're significant enough to hold back the entire site. The only way to know is to check.</p>
            
            <p>Technical SEO is one part of a broader <a href="/seo-services-sydney/">SEO services</a> approach. For businesses targeting local customers, technical work often pairs with <a href="/local-seo/">local SEO</a> to improve map pack visibility. For online stores, see <a href="/ecommerce-seo-sydney/">ecommerce SEO</a> for platform-specific technical requirements.</p>

<!-- Common Technical Issues Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Common Technical SEO Issues</h2>
            
            <h3>Site Speed</h3>
            <p>Slow sites rank worse and convert worse. Google's Core Web Vitals measure loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. Sites that fail these tests get lower rankings. I identify what's slowing your site down and fix it. Sometimes it's image optimisation. Sometimes it's server configuration. Sometimes it's bloated JavaScript. The fix depends on the cause.</p>
            
            <h3>Crawl and Index Problems</h3>
            <p>Google has a crawl budget for each site. If that budget gets wasted on duplicate pages, redirect chains, or low-value URLs, important pages might not get crawled. I find and fix crawl inefficiencies. This includes XML sitemap optimisation, robots.txt configuration, canonical tag implementation, and removing or consolidating duplicate content.</p>
            
            <h3>Mobile Usability</h3>
            <p>Google uses mobile-first indexing. Your mobile site is what gets ranked, not your desktop version. Sites with mobile usability issues, tiny text, clickable elements too close together, or content that displays poorly on phones lose rankings. I test mobile usability and fix problems.</p>
            
            <h3>Schema Markup</h3>
            <p>Schema is structured data that helps search engines understand your content. LocalBusiness schema, Service schema, FAQ schema, Product schema for ecommerce. Proper implementation can get you rich results in search listings. I implement and validate schema markup.</p>
            
            <h3>Internal Linking Structure</h3>
            <p>Internal links distribute authority across your site. Poor internal linking means some pages get ignored while others get more authority than they need. I structure internal links so authority flows to pages that matter for rankings and conversions.</p>
        </div>

<!-- Technical SEO Audit Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Technical SEO Audits</h2>
            <p>A technical audit gives you a complete picture of your site's technical health. I use a mix of tools and manual analysis to find issues that automated checks miss.</p>
            
            <p>What an audit covers:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Crawl analysis using Google Search Console and crawling tools</li>
                <li>Indexation review to find pages blocked from ranking</li>
                <li>Site speed testing and Core Web Vitals assessment</li>
                <li>Mobile usability testing</li>
                <li>Schema markup validation</li>
                <li>Internal linking structure analysis</li>
                <li>Redirect audit to find chains and loops</li>
                <li>Canonical tag implementation review</li>
                <li>Security and HTTPS configuration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You get a prioritised report. Issues are ranked by impact. Each issue has a specific recommendation for fixing it. Some fixes are quick. Some need developer time. Some need server configuration changes. I can implement most fixes directly or work with your developer.</p>

<!-- Platform-Specific Technical SEO Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Platform-Specific Technical SEO</h2>
            <p>Different platforms have different technical challenges. I work across:</p>
            
            <h3>WordPress</h3>
            <p>WordPress is the most common platform for Sydney business sites. Plugin conflicts, theme issues, database bloat, and caching configuration are typical problems. I know WordPress well and can fix most issues directly.</p>
            
            <h3>Shopify</h3>
            <p>Shopify has limitations around URL structure, canonical tags, and schema markup. I work within Shopify's constraints to optimise what's possible. This includes theme modifications, metafield implementations, and app configurations.</p>
            
            <h3>Custom Platforms</h3>
            <p>Custom-built sites have unique technical profiles. I work with your developer to implement fixes or make recommendations they can execute. You don't need a specific platform to get technical SEO help.</p>

<!-- Pricing Section -->

            <h2>Technical SEO Pricing</h2>
            <p>One-off technical SEO audits start at $1,500 for standard business websites. This includes the full audit, prioritised report, and a follow-up call to discuss findings.</p>
            
            <p>Ongoing technical SEO as part of a monthly campaign starts from $1,200 per month. This includes continuous monitoring, implementation of fixes, and adaptation as Google's requirements change.</p>
            
            <p>Large sites, ecommerce platforms, and sites with complex technical requirements are quoted based on scope. I'll give you a fixed price before starting so you know exactly what you're paying.</p>
