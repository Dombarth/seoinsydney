            <h2>What is Local SEO?</h2>
            <p>Local SEO focuses on improving visibility for searches with local intent. When someone searches for "plumber near me" or "cafe in Surry Hills," local SEO determines which businesses appear in those results.</p>
            <p>Local search results differ from standard organic results. They often include map listings, business information panels, and results weighted toward geographic proximity to the searcher.</p>
            <p>For businesses serving specific geographic areas, local SEO is often more valuable than broader search optimisation because it connects you with customers actively looking for services in your location.</p>

            <h2>How Local SEO Works</h2>
            <p>Local search ranking depends on three primary factors: relevance, distance, and prominence.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How well your business matches what the searcher is looking for</li>
                <li><strong>Distance:</strong> How close your business is to the searcher's location or the location specified in their search</li>
                <li><strong>Prominence:</strong> How well-known and authoritative your business appears online</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Local SEO work addresses all three factors through business listing optimisation, citation building, review management, and local content development.</p>

            <h2>Local SEO in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney's size and density create specific local SEO considerations. The metropolitan area spans dozens of suburbs, each with distinct search behaviour and competitive dynamics.</p>
            <p>Businesses operating in multiple locations need strategies that address each service area without creating duplicate content issues. Businesses in competitive suburbs face different challenges than those in less contested areas.</p>
            <p>Understanding Sydney's geographic search patterns—how people search by suburb, region, or "near me" terms—informs effective local SEO strategy. Local SEO works alongside broader <a href="/">SEO Sydney</a> strategies to maximise visibility.</p>
