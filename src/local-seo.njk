            <h2>What is Local SEO?</h2>
            <p>Local SEO focuses on improving visibility for searches with local intent. When someone searches for "plumber near me" or "cafe in Surry Hills," local SEO determines which businesses appear in those results.</p>
            <p>Local search results differ from standard organic results. They include map listings, business information panels, and results weighted toward geographic proximity to the searcher.</p>
            <p>For businesses that serve specific geographic areas, local SEO is often more valuable than broader search optimisation because it connects you with people actively looking for services in your location.</p>

            <h2>How Local SEO Works</h2>
            <p>Local search ranking depends on three primary factors:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How well your business matches what the searcher is looking for</li>
                <li><strong>Distance:</strong> How close your business is to the searcher or the location in their search</li>
                <li><strong>Prominence:</strong> How well-known and authoritative your business appears online</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Local SEO work addresses all three factors through business listing optimisation, citation building, review management and local content development.</p>

            <h2>Local SEO Across Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney's size and density create specific considerations for local SEO. The metropolitan area spans dozens of suburbs, each with distinct search behaviour and competitive dynamics.</p>
            <p>Businesses operating in multiple locations need strategies that address each service area without creating duplicate content issues. A plumber serving the inner west has different local SEO needs than a dentist in Parramatta or a lawyer in the CBD.</p>
            <p>We work with businesses across the CBD, inner west, eastern suburbs, north shore, northern beaches, Parramatta, western Sydney and Sutherland Shire. Understanding how people search by suburb, region and "near me" terms in each area informs our approach.</p>
