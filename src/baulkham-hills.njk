<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Baulkham Hills and across the Hills District. We've been working with businesses around Windsor Road, Old Northern Road, Seven Hills Road and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Baulkham Hills has continued to grow as one of the most established residential areas in the Hills District with a strong local business community.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Baulkham Hills is a large residential suburb with commercial centres along Windsor Road and scattered through the neighbourhood shopping strips. Theres a mix of medical practices, dental clinics, accounting firms, real estate agencies, trades businesses and retail. For businesses in Baulkham Hills the customer base is predominantly families who value convenience and reliability. Its a suburb where people search for services nearby rather than travelling to larger centres unless they have to. Local SEO works well here because the search intent is strong and the competition is moderate compared to Castle Hill or Parramatta.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on an accounting practice near Windsor Road in late 2021 that had been operating for about seven years. Two accountants specialising in small business tax, BAS and SMSF. They were getting most of their clients from referrals and their existing client base which is where most of their new work had always come from. Their website was a basic three page template with no service specific content and they didn't have a Google Business Profile set up at all. We built out individual service pages for tax returns, BAS, SMSF administration and business advisory, created content around tax deadline and compliance topics, set up and optimised the GBP and built links from accounting directories. Over about eight months their organic enquiries went from essentially zero to about six per month. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the financial content which a lot of other agencies in the Hills District outsource.</p>

<p>The home services market in Baulkham Hills is consistently strong. Its an established suburb with a lot of houses that need ongoing maintenance and renovation work. Electricians, plumbers, painters, landscapers and builders who target Baulkham Hills through local SEO can build a steady pipeline of work from homeowners searching for reliable local tradespeople.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Baulkham Hills businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For accounting firms and professional services in Baulkham Hills its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Baulkham Hills business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Baulkham Hills area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
