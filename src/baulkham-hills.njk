<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Baulkham Hills and the surrounding Hills District suburbs. Baulkham Hills is one of the larger residential areas in the Hills with a strong local business community along Windsor Road, Old Northern Road and around the Stockland shopping centre. The businesses here primarily serve families and homeowners which shapes the type of search terms that matter.</p>

<p>The trades and home services market in Baulkham Hills is substantial. Builders, plumbers, electricians, landscapers, pool installers and renovation companies all serve the large housing stock in the area. Most of these businesses rely on word of mouth and the occasional Hipages or ServiceSeeking lead. The ones that invest in SEO capture organic search traffic without paying per lead to a third party platform which makes a significant difference to their margins over time.</p>

<p>We started working with a landscaping company based in Baulkham Hills in early 2023. They'd been operating for about six years doing residential landscaping, retaining walls, driveways and outdoor living areas across the Hills. Their website was a basic site with a gallery and contact form. They were getting most of their work from Hipages and were paying $30 to $50 per lead. We built a proper website with individual service pages, project case studies with before and after photos and suburb targeting pages for the areas they worked in most. We optimised the GBP and built links from home improvement and building directories. Within about seven months they were ranking for landscaping searches across the Hills District. Their organic leads went from essentially zero to about twelve per month. The owner told us he reduced his Hipages spend by about 70% because the organic leads were higher quality and converting better.</p>

<p>For the retail and food businesses around the Stockland centre local SEO and GBP management are essential. People search for nearby options before deciding where to eat or shop.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
