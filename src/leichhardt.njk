<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation services for businesses in Leichhardt and along the Norton Street precinct. Leichhardt has always been known as Sydney's Little Italy and while the area has diversified over the years Norton Street is still the heart of the local business scene with Italian restaurants, cafes, gelato shops and a mix of other hospitality and retail businesses.</p>

<p>The main commercial strip runs along Norton Street from Parramatta Road through to Marion Street with a cluster of businesses around the Italian Forum. Theres also commercial activity along Balmain Road and around the Leichhardt Marketplace. Most of the businesses here are small independent operators and a lot of them have been around for twenty or thirty years.</p>

<p>We picked up an Italian restaurant on Norton Street in 2022 that had been there since the early 2000s. They had a loyal regular crowd but were seeing new restaurants open up around them with much better online visibility. Their website hadn't been updated since about 2015 and the Google Business Profile had wrong opening hours and no recent photos. We rebuilt the site, updated the GBP with current photos and menu information, cleaned up about 15 old directory listings and built a few links from Sydney food blogs. Within about five months they were back in the top three map results for Italian restaurant searches in the inner west area.</p>

<p>There are also quite a few medical practices and allied health businesses in the Leichhardt area. GP clinics, physiotherapists, dentists, psychologists. These businesses compete across the inner west for patient searches and the ones who have done even basic local SEO work tend to dominate because most haven't done anything.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. No setup fees, no contracts. Month to month with 30 days notice. Written quote with full breakdown before any work begins.</p>

<p>All work done in house. We don't send anything offshore.</p>
