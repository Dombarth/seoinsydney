<h2>The Search Landscape in Leichhardt</h2>

<p>Leichhardt's commercial activity centres on Norton Street and the surrounding blocks. The suburb is known for its Italian restaurant and cafe precinct, but it also has a significant number of health practitioners, professional services firms, retail businesses and trades operating from the Parramatta Road corridor.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Leichhardt:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Concentrated hospitality competition along Norton Street</li>
    <li>Health and medical practices serving the inner west population</li>
    <li>Professional services firms in the side streets and surrounding area</li>
    <li>Parramatta Road corridor with trade and automotive businesses</li>
    <li>Moderate overall competition that responds well to consistent SEO investment</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Leichhardt</h2>

<p>We worked with a family medical practice on Marion Street that had been operating for about fifteen years. They had three GPs and a practice nurse, with a patient base built entirely through local reputation. Their website was a basic template with contact details and opening hours but no content about their services or practitioners. Over about five months we rebuilt the site with pages for each service area, created practitioner profiles, optimised their Google Business Profile and built citations across medical directories. The practice started receiving new patient enquiries through search within three months.</p>

<p>The restaurant market on Norton Street presents a specific challenge. There are many Italian dining venues competing for the same searches, and the businesses that appear in the map pack tend to be the ones that have invested in their Google Business Profile. Review volume, photo quality, response to reviews and correct category selection all matter. Most restaurants on Norton Street have a basic GBP but have not maintained it actively.</p>
