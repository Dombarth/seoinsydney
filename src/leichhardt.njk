<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Leichhardt and across the inner west. We've been working with businesses around Norton Street, Marion Street, Parramatta Road and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Leichhardt has retained its character despite the development happening around the light rail corridor and the Italian Forum.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Leichhardt is known for its Italian heritage and Norton Street has long been the main dining and retail strip. Theres a solid concentration of restaurants, cafes, medical practices, legal offices and trade businesses. For businesses in Leichhardt the competition is moderate compared to suburbs like Newtown or Surry Hills but its growing as the area becomes more connected via the light rail. Its a suburb where businesses that invest in SEO early can build a strong position before the competition catches up.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a family run Italian restaurant on Norton Street in late 2019 that had been there for over twenty years. They had a loyal following but their customer base was ageing and younger diners were going to Newtown and Marrickville instead which is where most of the new dining traffic had shifted to. Their website was outdated and their Google Business Profile had incorrect hours and old photos. We rebuilt the site, created content around their menu and catering services, sorted out the GBP with professional photos and proper categories, and built links from food directories and local blogs. Over about six months they started seeing a noticeable increase in younger customers who found them through search. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all the content and GBP management in house which a lot of other agencies in Leichhardt outsource.</p>

<p>The medical and allied health sector along Marion Street and the surrounding area is another strong category in Leichhardt. Theres GPs, dentists, physiotherapists and specialists all within a short walk of each other. Most of them have basic websites and rely on referrals. A medical practice in Leichhardt that invests in local SEO can consistently attract self referred patients who are searching for practitioners nearby.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Leichhardt businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical practices and hospitality in Leichhardt its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many services or locations are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Leichhardt business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Leichhardt area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
