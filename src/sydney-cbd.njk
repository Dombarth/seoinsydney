faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for CBD businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services in competitive categories such as law, accounting, and financial services, campaigns typically range from $2,000 to $3,000 depending on the number of practice areas and the level of competition. A written quote with a full breakdown is provided before work begins."
  - q: "How competitive is SEO in the area?"
    a: "The area is the most competitive search market in Australia. Businesses across law, finance, technology, hospitality, and professional services all compete for the same high-intent commercial search terms. Organic rankings in the 2000 postcode take longer to achieve than any other Sydney suburb, but the commercial value of those positions is proportionally higher."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the Sydney metropolitan area including Surry Hills, Pyrmont, Ultimo, North Sydney, Parramatta, and all suburbs in between. The approach is the same regardless of location — tailored to the specific search landscape of the area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time and the CBD is a competitive market, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters in the area</h2>

<p>The area covers the 2000 postcode and is the commercial centre of Australia. The area stretches from Circular Quay and The Rocks in the north to Central Station in the south, bounded by Darling Harbour to the west and the Royal Botanic Gardens to the east. It contains the highest concentration of law firms, accounting practices, financial services companies, technology businesses, and hospitality venues in the country. Martin Place, George Street, Pitt Street, and Macquarie Street form the core commercial corridors.</p>

<p>Search competition in the CBD is the most intense in Australia. Businesses that rank organically for high-intent terms in the 2000 postcode receive some of the most valuable search traffic available. For professional services firms and B2B companies, a consistent organic presence in CBD search results generates qualified leads that convert at higher rates than paid advertising.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for CBD businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $2,000 to $3,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
