<p>We provide search engine optimisation for businesses in the Sydney CBD and across the city centre. We have been working with businesses around George Street, Pitt Street, Martin Place, Macquarie Street and the surrounding areas since 2014. The CBD has changed considerably in that time, particularly around Barangaroo and the Circular Quay precinct.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock-in contracts and local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is handled in-house by our Sydney-based team.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape in Sydney CBD</h2>

<p>The Sydney CBD is the most competitive market in the country for professional services SEO. There are hundreds of law firms, accounting practices, financial advisors, migration agents and corporate service providers all targeting the same search terms. The businesses that have been investing in SEO for two or three years already have a significant head start, and catching up takes time and consistency.</p>

<p>Key characteristics of CBD search competition:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High density of professional services firms targeting overlapping keywords</li>
    <li>Strong existing domain authority among established competitors</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile optimisation is critical for map pack visibility</li>
    <li>Content depth and link quality matter more than volume</li>
    <li>Multiple practice areas or service lines require individual page targeting</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in the CBD</h2>

<p>We took on a commercial law firm near Phillip Street in early 2020 that had been operating for about twelve years. Five partners, solid reputation in their field but almost zero organic visibility. Their website was a six-page brochure site that had not been updated since 2016 and their Google Business Profile was set up under the wrong category.</p>

<p>Over about ten months we rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around the specific legal searches their potential clients were making and corrected the GBP. We built links from legal directories, bar association listings and a couple of industry publications. They went from having almost no organic traffic to ranking on the first page for several commercial law terms in the Sydney CBD.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in the Sydney CBD is a different challenge. There are well over a thousand restaurants, cafes and bars competing for food and dining searches across the city. For a restaurant the map pack is everything and most of them have not optimised their GBP properly. Even basic local SEO can make a noticeable difference because the competition is wide but shallow.</p>

<h2>What We Cover</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Technical SEO audits and fixes</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and ongoing management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service and practice area pages</li>
    <li>Content strategy and production</li>
    <li>Link building from relevant industry sources</li>
    <li>Citation management across directories</li>
    <li>Monthly reporting with clear metrics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Sydney CBD businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories like legal, accounting and financial planning, it usually sits between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many practice areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave, everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business receives proper attention.</p>
