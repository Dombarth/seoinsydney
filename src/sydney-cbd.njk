<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in the Sydney CBD and across the city centre. We've been working with businesses around George Street, Pitt Street, Martin Place, Macquarie Street and the surrounding areas since about 2014 and the CBD has changed a lot in that time particularly around Barangaroo and the Circular Quay end.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>The Sydney CBD is the most competitive market in the country for professional services SEO. Theres hundreds of law firms, accounting practices, financial advisors, migration agents and corporate service providers all targeting the same search terms. For businesses in the Sydney CBD the ones who have been investing in SEO for two or three years already have a significant head start and catching up takes time and consistency. Its not something that happens in three months.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a commercial law firm near Phillip Street in early 2020 that had been operating for about twelve years. Five partners, solid reputation in their field but almost zero organic visibility. Their website was a six page brochure site that hadn't been touched since about 2016 and their Google Business Profile was set up under the wrong category which is where most of their issues started from. Over about ten months we rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around the specific legal searches their potential clients were making and sorted out the GBP. We built links from legal directories, bar association listings and a couple of industry publications. They went from having almost no organic traffic to ranking on the first page for several commercial law terms in the Sydney CBD. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all the content and technical work in house which a lot of other agencies in this area don't really bother with.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in the Sydney CBD is a different challenge entirely. Theres probably a thousand restaurants, cafes and bars competing for food and dining searches across the city. For a restaurant the map pack is everything and most of them haven't optimised their GBP properly. Even basic local SEO can make a noticeable difference in the CBD because the competition is wide but shallow.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Sydney CBD businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories like legal, accounting and financial planning its usually between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many practice areas are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, citation management, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since we started and we've kept the majority of our Sydney CBD clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Sydney CBD strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Sydney CBD. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
