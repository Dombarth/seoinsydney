<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation and local SEO for businesses operating in the Sydney CBD. The city centre is one of the most competitive search markets in Australia and we've been working with businesses in and around George Street, Pitt Street, Martin Place and Circular Quay since 2015.</p>

<p>The CBD is dominated by professional services. Law firms, accounting practices, financial advisors, commercial real estate agents and corporate consultancies. Most of them are competing for the same search terms and the ones that invested in SEO three or four years ago have a significant head start. If you're a professional services firm in the city that hasn't done any SEO work you're already behind.</p>

<p>We took on a commercial law firm on Phillip Street in mid 2022 that had a decent website but almost no organic visibility. They were spending about $4,000 a month on Google Ads and getting leads but wanted to reduce that spend over time. Their website had no individual practice area pages, no schema markup, and the Google Business Profile was barely filled out. Over about twelve months we built out proper service pages for each practice area, fixed the technical issues, built links from relevant legal directories and industry publications. By the end of 2023 they had cut their Ads spend in half and were getting more enquiries from organic than they ever got from paid.</p>

<p>The hospitality sector in the CBD is also very competitive. Restaurants and bars around Barangaroo, The Rocks and Circular Quay are all fighting for visibility from both locals and tourists. The search patterns are different to professional services because there's a lot more "near me" and map based searching happening.</p>

<p>We handle on page SEO, technical SEO, content, link building, Google Business Profile optimisation and monthly reporting. Local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. For competitive CBD industries like legal or financial services its usually higher depending on the scope.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. No lock in contracts. Everything we build stays yours if you leave.</p>

<p>All work is done in house by our Sydney based team. I review every strategy personally and each specialist manages no more than fifteen accounts at a time.</p>
