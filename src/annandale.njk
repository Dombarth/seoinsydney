<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Annandale. Annandale is quieter than its neighbours Newtown and Leichhardt but theres a solid strip of businesses along Johnston Street and Booth Street that serve the local residential community. Cafes, restaurants, a few pubs, antique dealers and a scattering of small professional services and trades businesses.</p>

<p>Its mostly a residential suburb but the businesses that are here tend to rely heavily on local customers. The people searching for a cafe or a restaurant in Annandale are almost always locals and they're searching on their phones. If your Google Business Profile isn't set up properly or your website doesn't exist you're essentially invisible to them.</p>

<p>We took on a local painter and decorator based in Annandale in late 2022. He'd been operating for about fifteen years, mostly through word of mouth and referrals from real estate agents. He had no website at all and his Google Business Profile had his mobile number wrong. We built him a basic website with service pages for interior painting, exterior painting and commercial work, set up the Google Business Profile properly, got him listed in local trade directories and built a few links from inner west business sites. He went from getting maybe one call a month from Google to getting five or six. For a one man operation thats a big increase.</p>

<p>Annandale is also home to a few antique shops and specialty retail businesses that attract customers from across Sydney. These businesses need to rank for broader search terms, not just local ones. "Antique furniture Sydney" or "vintage lighting inner west" are the types of searches that can drive significant traffic to a small shop that most people wouldn't otherwise know about.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. No setup fees, no contracts. Month to month, 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All done by our Sydney based team.</p>
