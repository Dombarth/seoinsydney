<h2>The Search Landscape in Annandale</h2>

<p>Annandale sits between Leichhardt, Glebe and Stanmore in the inner west. The suburb is predominantly residential with commercial activity concentrated along Johnston Street and parts of Parramatta Road. The businesses in Annandale tend to be local services, health practitioners, cafes and trades rather than the high-density hospitality strips found in neighbouring suburbs.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Annandale:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Primarily residential suburb with local service-focused businesses</li>
    <li>Health and wellness practitioners serving the inner west</li>
    <li>Small hospitality sector with cafes and neighbourhood restaurants</li>
    <li>Trade businesses operating from Parramatta Road corridor</li>
    <li>Lower search competition compared to Newtown, Glebe and Leichhardt</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Annandale</h2>

<p>We worked with a psychology practice on Johnston Street that had two practitioners and was relying entirely on referrals from local GPs. Their website was a single page with their names, qualifications and a phone number. Over about four months we rebuilt the site with individual pages for each area of practice, optimised their Google Business Profile with proper health categories and service descriptions, and built citations across psychology and health directories. The practice started receiving enquiries from people in the inner west who were searching for specific therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>For trade businesses based in Annandale along Parramatta Road, the SEO approach focuses on service-area targeting rather than suburb-specific search. These businesses typically serve customers across a wider geographic range, so Google Business Profile service areas and location-specific service pages are the primary drivers.</p>

    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
