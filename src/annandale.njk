faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues on Johnston Street or health practices in competitive categories, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2038 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. Businesses in categories with lower online competition, such as trades and specialist health services, can see results sooner."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the inner west including Glebe, Leichhardt, Rozelle, Lilyfield, Camperdown, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is an inner west suburb within the 2038 postcode, bordered by Glebe to the east, Leichhardt to the west, and Rozelle and Lilyfield to the north. Johnston Street is the main commercial strip, with a mix of cafes, restaurants, pubs, and local retail. The suburb is predominantly residential, characterised by Victorian and Federation-era terraces on a ridge that runs between Johnstons Creek and Whites Creek. The area's population includes young professionals, families, and long-term residents drawn to its village atmosphere and proximity to the CBD.</p>

<p>Search competition here is moderate to low for most service categories. The suburb functions as a local commercial centre rather than a destination, which means businesses on Johnston Street and Parramatta Road serve a defined catchment of nearby residents. For trades, health practitioners, and hospitality businesses, a targeted local SEO campaign can establish search visibility relatively quickly. The residential density of the suburb and its central inner west position create consistent search demand for home services, dining, and professional services.</p>

<h2>The Search Landscape</h2>

<p>Johnston Street drives the primary commercial search demand here. Cafes, restaurants, and pubs compete for dining-related queries, though the competition level is lower than in neighbouring Glebe or Newtown. For these businesses, Google Business Profile optimisation, review management, and accurate business information are the foundations of local search visibility.</p>

<p>Parramatta Road along the southern boundary of the area carries commercial search demand for automotive services, furniture stores, and larger retail operations. These businesses often serve a broader catchment extending across the inner west. The residential streets of the area generate steady demand for plumbing, electrical, renovation, and home maintenance searches, driven by the suburb's ageing terrace housing stock that requires regular specialist work.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
