<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Annandale and across the inner west. We've been working with businesses along Johnston Street, Booth Street, Parramatta Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Annandale has maintained its quiet residential character while the suburbs around it have become busier.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Annandale is primarily residential with a small commercial strip along Johnston Street and some businesses along the Parramatta Road corridor. Theres a mix of cafes, pubs, medical practices, trades businesses and a handful of professional services firms. For businesses in Annandale the customer base is very local and searches tend to be specific. People living in Annandale search for nearby services rather than going to a bigger commercial strip unless they have to. Its a suburb where local SEO can have a significant impact because theres less competition compared to Newtown or Leichhardt but the search volume from residents is still there.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with a dental practice on Johnston Street in late 2020 that had been operating for about eleven years. Two dentists and a hygienist. They had a steady patient base but it was shrinking as older patients moved away and they weren't attracting enough new ones which is where most of their growth concerns came from. Their website was a basic template with a homepage and a services page and their Google Business Profile hadn't been updated since they set it up. We rebuilt the site with individual treatment pages, created content around common dental concerns, sorted out the GBP with proper photos and categories and built links from dental directories and health publications. Over about eight months their new patient bookings went from about three a week to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that work in house including the dental content which a lot of other agencies outsource to generic writers.</p>

<p>The trades and home services market in Annandale is strong because its an older suburb with a lot of terrace houses that need constant maintenance. Electricians, plumbers, painters and builders who service the Annandale area can benefit significantly from local SEO because homeowners search for nearby tradespeople when something needs fixing and they want someone local.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Annandale businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For dental practices and medical services in Annandale its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on how many treatments and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Annandale business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Annandale area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
