<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Mascot and across the inner south. We've been working with businesses around Botany Road, Bourke Street, Gardeners Road, King Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Mascot has transformed from a largely industrial suburb into a high density residential and commercial hub driven by its proximity to the airport and the train line.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Mascot has a growing population of young professionals living in the apartment developments along Bourke Street and around the station. Theres a mix of hospitality, medical practices, retail businesses, trade services and corporate offices particularly in the business parks closer to the airport. For businesses in Mascot the customer base is growing faster than the supply of local services which creates an opportunity for businesses that establish strong online visibility early. Its a suburb where the population is digitally oriented and searches for everything from their nearest GP to their morning coffee.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a physiotherapy clinic near Bourke Street in mid 2022 that had opened about two years earlier. Two physios specialising in office worker injuries and general musculoskeletal conditions. They were getting most of their patients from building management referrals and walk ins which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was a Squarespace template with limited service information and their Google Business Profile needed updating. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and treatment pages, created content around desk posture, back pain and common office injuries, sorted out the GBP and built links from physiotherapy associations and health directories. Over about six months their new patient bookings from organic search went from about two per week to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the physiotherapy content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource.</p>

<p>The hospitality market in Mascot is growing as the apartment population increases. New cafes and restaurants are opening regularly. A hospitality business in Mascot that invests in local SEO can build a strong position before the market becomes saturated because right now the online competition is still relatively weak compared to the number of residents searching for nearby dining options.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Mascot businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical and physiotherapy practices in Mascot its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services and conditions are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Mascot business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Mascot area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
