            <h2>How Getting Customers From Google Works</h2>
            <p>When someone searches for a service you offer, Google shows results it thinks are most relevant and useful. Appearing in those results brings visitors to your site. Some of those visitors become customers.</p>
            
            <p>The process looks like this:</p>
            <ol class="content-list">
                <li>Someone searches for something related to your business</li>
                <li>Your website appears in the results</li>
                <li>They click through to your site</li>
                <li>They find what they need and contact you</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Getting more customers from Google means improving each step. More visibility in search, more clicks, more conversions on your site.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Understand Search Intent Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 1: Understand How People Search</h2>
            <p>Before you can appear in search results, you need to know what people are actually searching for. This isn't always obvious.</p>
            
            <p>Someone looking for a plumber might search:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>"plumber near me"</li>
                <li>"emergency plumber Sydney"</li>
                <li>"blocked drain repair cost"</li>
                <li>"how to fix a leaking tap"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each search has different intent. "Near me" means they want someone local now. "Cost" means they're comparing prices. "How to" means they might try to fix it themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Your potential customers are searching in ways you might not expect. Keyword research finds these searches so you can create pages that match them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Create Matching Pages Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 2: Create Pages That Match Those Searches</h2>
            <p>Google shows pages that answer what the searcher is looking for. If someone searches "dentist Parramatta" and your page clearly shows you're a dentist in Parramatta, you have a chance to appear.</p>
            
            <p>What this means in practice:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Service pages:</strong> A page for each main service you offer, describing what it is and who it's for</li>
                <li><strong>Location pages:</strong> Pages showing where you operate, for businesses serving specific areas</li>
                <li><strong>Informational content:</strong> Articles answering questions your customers ask, capturing research-stage searches</li>
                <li><strong>Clear titles and descriptions:</strong> Page titles that match what people search, meta descriptions that encourage clicks</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The content needs to be genuinely useful. Thin pages with minimal information don't rank well. Write enough to actually answer the question or explain the service.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Google Business Profile Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 3: Optimise Your Google Business Profile</h2>
            <p>For local businesses, Google Business Profile is essential. This is what appears in Google Maps and the local pack at the top of search results.</p>
            
            <p>Setting up your profile properly:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Claim or create your listing at <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.google.com</a></li>
                <li>Fill out every section completely and accurately</li>
                <li>Choose the right business categories</li>
                <li>Add photos of your business, work, and team</li>
                <li>Get reviews from customers and respond to them</li>
                <li>Post updates about your services or offers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A well-optimised Google Business Profile can bring in customers even if your website doesn't rank well. It's often the fastest way to start appearing in local search results.</p>

<!-- Build Authority Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 4: Build Authority</h2>
            <p>Google prefers websites that seem trustworthy and authoritative. For competitive searches, having good content isn't enough. You also need signals that your site is worth ranking.</p>
            
            <p>Authority comes from:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Links from other websites:</strong> When reputable sites link to yours, it signals trust. Not all links are equal. One link from a relevant industry site is worth more than dozens from random directories.</li>
                <li><strong>Content depth:</strong> Sites with substantial, useful content tend to rank better than thin sites. This doesn't mean writing more words for the sake of it. It means covering topics thoroughly.</li>
                <li><strong>User signals:</strong> If people stay on your site, visit multiple pages, and don't bounce back to search results, that's a positive signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Brand mentions:</strong> Being mentioned online, even without links, can contribute to authority.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Building authority takes time. It's not something you can rush with shortcuts. Consistent effort over months produces results.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Get the Technical Basics Right</h2>
            <p>Your site needs to work well for both visitors and search engines. Technical issues can hold back even great content.</p>
            
            <p>Key technical factors:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Site speed:</strong> Slow sites frustrate visitors and rank worse. Aim for under 3 seconds load time.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile usability:</strong> Your site needs to work well on phones. Google uses mobile-first indexing.</li>
                <li><strong>Crawlability:</strong> Search engines need to be able to find and access your pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS is expected. Sites without it get warnings in browsers.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear structure:</strong> Logical navigation and internal linking help both visitors and search engines.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Most technical issues are fixable. The first step is knowing what's wrong.</p>
