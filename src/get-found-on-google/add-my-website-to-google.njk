            <h2>First: Check If Google Already Knows About Your Site</h2>
            <p>Before you do anything, check whether your site is already in Google's index. Go to Google and search for:</p>
            
            <p><code>site:yourdomain.com.au</code></p>
            
            <p>Replace "yourdomain.com.au" with your actual domain. If you see results, Google has already found your site. The problem might be something else, like low rankings or technical issues.</p>
            
            <p>If you see no results, your site isn't indexed yet. The steps below will fix that.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Set Up Google Search Console</h2>
            <p>Google Search Console is a free tool that lets you see how Google views your site. It's also how you tell Google your site exists.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what to do:</p>
            <ol class="content-list">
                <li>Go to <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search.google.com/search-console</a></li>
                <li>Sign in with a Google account</li>
                <li>Click "Add a property" and enter your website URL</li>
                <li>Verify you own the site (there are several methods, the easiest is usually adding a record to your domain DNS or uploading a file to your website)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If the verification steps sound complicated, your web developer can do this in about five minutes. Or I can help you set it up.</p>

<!-- Submit Sitemap Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 2: Submit Your Sitemap</h2>
            <p>A sitemap is a file that lists all the pages on your website. It helps Google find everything quickly.</p>
            
            <p>Most websites have a sitemap already. Try going to:</p>
            <p><code>yourdomain.com.au/sitemap.xml</code></p>
            
            <p>If you see a file with a list of URLs, you have a sitemap. If not, you'll need to create one. Most website platforms can generate this automatically.</p>
            
            <p>Once you have a sitemap:</p>
            <ol class="content-list">
                <li>Open Google Search Console</li>
                <li>Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu</li>
                <li>Enter your sitemap URL (usually sitemap.xml)</li>
                <li>Click "Submit"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This tells Google where to find all your pages. Google will queue them for crawling.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Step 3: Request Indexing for Important Pages</h2>
            <p>You can ask Google to crawl specific pages immediately rather than waiting for them to be discovered naturally.</p>
            
            <p>In Google Search Console:</p>
            <ol class="content-list">
                <li>Copy the URL of an important page (like your homepage)</li>
                <li>Paste it into the search bar at the top of Search Console</li>
                <li>Click "Request indexing"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Google will queue the page for crawling. This usually happens within hours to a few days. You can do this for up to about 10 pages per day.</p>
            
            <p>Focus on your most important pages first. Homepage, main service pages, contact page. Google will find the rest through links on those pages.</p>

<!-- Why Site May Not Be Indexed Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why Your Site Might Not Be Getting Indexed</h2>
            <p>If you've done the steps above and your site still isn't showing up, there might be a technical problem blocking Google.</p>
            
            <p>Common issues:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Robots.txt blocking Google:</strong> This file tells search engines what not to crawl. Sometimes it's configured incorrectly and blocks everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Noindex tags:</strong> Code on your pages telling search engines not to index them. Sometimes left over from development.</li>
                <li><strong>Password protection:</strong> If your site requires a login, Google can't see it.</li>
                <li><strong>Very new domain:</strong> Brand new domains with no links can take longer to be discovered.</li>
                <li><strong>Previous penalty:</strong> If the domain was used for spam in the past, it might have a manual action.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Google Search Console will show you if there are coverage issues. Look under "Index" then "Coverage" to see what's blocked and why.</p>
