            <h2>First: Is Your Site Actually Not Indexed?</h2>
            <p>There's a difference between "not indexed" and "not ranking well". Let's figure out which one you have.</p>
            
            <p>Go to Google and search for:</p>
            <p><code>site:yourdomain.com.au</code></p>
            
            <p>What happens:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Results appear:</strong> Your site is indexed. The problem is rankings, not indexing. Your site exists in Google but doesn't show up for the searches you care about.</li>
                <li><strong>No results appear:</strong> Your site is not indexed. Google doesn't know it exists or can't access it. This is a different problem with different solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The fix depends on which situation you're in.</p>

<!-- Not Indexed Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>If Your Site Is Not Indexed</h2>
            <p>Google hasn't found your site or can't access it. Here are the common reasons:</p>
            
            <h3>New Website</h3>
            <p>Brand new sites take time to be discovered. Google finds new sites through links from other sites. A new domain with no external links might not be found for weeks. You can speed this up by submitting your site through Google Search Console.</p>
            
            <h3>Robots.txt Blocking Google</h3>
            <p>Robots.txt is a file that tells search engines what they can and can't crawl. Sometimes it's set to block everything, often left over from development. Check <code>yourdomain.com.au/robots.txt</code> and look for "Disallow: /" which means "block everything".</p>
            
            <h3>Noindex Tags</h3>
            <p>Individual pages can have code telling search engines not to index them. This looks like <code><meta name="robots" content="noindex"></code> in the page HTML. Sometimes developers leave this on after testing and forget to remove it.</p>
            
            <h3>Password Protection</h3>
            <p>If your site requires a login to view any content, Google can't see it. This includes coming soon pages and staging sites.</p>
            
            <h3>Server Issues</h3>
            <p>If your site is frequently down or returns errors when Google tries to crawl, it might not get indexed. Check Google Search Console for crawl errors.</p>
            
            <h3>Previous Penalty</h3>
            <p>If the domain was used for spam in the past, it might have a manual action. Check the "Security and Manual Actions" section in Google Search Console.</p>

<!-- Indexed But Not Ranking Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>If Your Site Is Indexed But Not Ranking</h2>
            <p>Your site is in Google but doesn't appear when you search for relevant terms. This is more common than you might think.</p>
            
            <h3>Competition</h3>
            <p>For any search term, there are usually many websites trying to rank. Only ten spots on the first page. If your competitors have stronger websites with more content and more links, they'll rank above you.</p>
            
            <h3>Content Doesn't Match Search Intent</h3>
            <p>Google tries to show results that answer what the searcher is looking for. If someone searches "plumber Sydney" and your page is a generic homepage with no clear indication you're a plumber in Sydney, you won't rank for that term.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Issues</h3>
            <p>Slow page speed, mobile usability problems, duplicate content, and other technical issues can hold back rankings even for indexed sites.</p>
            
            <h3>Weak Authority</h3>
            <p>Google uses links from other sites as a signal of quality. A new site with no external links has less authority than an established site with many quality links. Building authority takes time and effort.</p>
            
            <h3>Search Personalisation</h3>
            <p>Google shows different results to different people based on location, search history, and other factors. Just because you don't see your site doesn't mean no one does. Try searching in an incognito window or from a different device.</p>
