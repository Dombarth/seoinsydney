<!-- Start With the Basics Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Start With the Basics</h2>
            <p>Before promoting your website, make sure it's worth promoting. A site that doesn't work well, doesn't explain what you offer, or doesn't convert visitors into customers will waste your promotion efforts.</p>
            
            <p>Check these first:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Does it load quickly?</strong> Under 3 seconds is the target. Slow sites lose visitors before they see anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Does it work on mobile?</strong> Most people browse on phones. If your site is hard to use on mobile, you're losing them.</li>
                <li><strong>Is it clear what you do?</strong> Someone landing on your homepage should understand within seconds what you offer and who it's for.</li>
                <li><strong>Is there a clear next step?</strong> Contact form, phone number, booking button. Make it easy for visitors to become customers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Fixing these issues first means your promotion efforts won't be wasted on a site that doesn't convert.</p>
        </div>

<!-- Search Engine Optimisation Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
            <p>SEO is about appearing in search results when people look for what you offer. It's not instant, but it produces lasting results without per-click costs.</p>
            
            <h3>What SEO Involves</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Keyword research:</strong> Finding out what your potential customers actually search for</li>
                <li><strong>Content creation:</strong> Pages that answer those searches and explain your services</li>
                <li><strong>Technical optimisation:</strong> Making sure search engines can find and understand your site</li>
                <li><strong>Link building:</strong> Getting other websites to link to yours, building authority</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Timeline for SEO</h3>
            <p>SEO takes time. Expect three to six months to see meaningful results for most businesses. Some technical fixes can show improvements faster. Competitive industries take longer.</p>
            
            <p>The advantage of SEO is that once you rank well, you get consistent traffic without paying for each click. It compounds over time.</p>

<!-- Local Visibility Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Local Visibility</h2>
            <p>For businesses serving local customers, appearing in local search results is essential.</p>
            
            <h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
            <p>This is the listing that appears in Google Maps and local search results. Set it up at <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.google.com</a>. Fill out every section, add photos, get reviews, and post updates regularly.</p>
            
            <h3>Local Directories</h3>
            <p>List your business on relevant directories. For Australian businesses, this includes True Local, Yellow Pages, Hotfrog, and industry-specific directories. Keep your business name, address, and phone number consistent across all listings.</p>
            
            <h3>Location Pages on Your Site</h3>
            <p>If you serve multiple areas, create pages for each location. A plumber serving all of Sydney might have pages for Parramatta, North Sydney, and other key areas. These pages should have genuine, useful content, not just duplicate text with the suburb name changed.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Content Marketing Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Content Marketing</h2>
            <p>Creating useful content attracts visitors who are researching before they're ready to buy. It also builds authority and gives search engines more pages to rank.</p>
            
            <h3>What Content to Create</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Answer common questions:</strong> What do customers ask you? Write pages answering those questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Explain your services:</strong> Detailed pages about what each service involves, who it's for, and what to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Share your expertise:</strong> Guides, how-tos, and insights that demonstrate you know your field.</li>
                <li><strong>Case studies:</strong> Real examples of problems you've solved for customers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
            <p>One genuinely useful page is worth more than ten thin pages. Write enough to actually answer the question or explain the topic. If you're not sure what to write, look at what already ranks for your target searches and create something better.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Building Authority Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Building Authority</h2>
            <p>Search engines prefer websites that appear trustworthy and authoritative. Building authority takes time but improves all your search rankings.</p>
            
            <h3>Getting Links</h3>
            <p>Links from other websites tell search engines your site is worth referencing. Focus on quality over quantity. A few links from relevant, reputable sites are worth more than many links from low-quality directories.</p>
            <p>Ways to get links:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Industry associations and business groups</li>
                <li>Local business directories and chambers of commerce</li>
                <li>Guest posts on relevant blogs</li>
                <li>Sponsorships and community involvement</li>
                <li>Creating content worth linking to</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Being Mentioned Online</h3>
            <p>Even without links, being mentioned on other sites, in reviews, and on social media contributes to your online presence. It all adds up.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Paid Advertising Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Paid Advertising</h2>
            <p>You don't need to pay for ads to promote your website, but they can be useful in some situations.</p>
            
            <h3>Google Ads</h3>
            <p>Pay-per-click advertising puts you at the top of search results immediately. You pay each time someone clicks. This works well for:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>New websites waiting for SEO to take effect</li>
                <li>Highly competitive searches where organic ranking is difficult</li>
                <li>Time-sensitive promotions or offers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Social Media Ads</h3>
            <p>Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn ads can drive traffic and build awareness. These work better for some businesses than others. Test with a small budget before committing heavily.</p>
            
            <h3>The Trade-Off</h3>
            <p>Paid ads work immediately but stop when you stop paying. SEO takes time but produces lasting results. Most businesses benefit from a combination, with the mix depending on goals and budget.</p>
        </div>

<!-- Getting Help Section -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Getting Help</h2>
            <p>Promoting a website effectively requires consistent effort across multiple areas. The specific approach that works best depends on your business type, competition, and goals.</p>
            
            <p>I help Sydney businesses work out what will actually make a difference for them. Sometimes it's SEO. Sometimes it's local visibility. Sometimes it's fixing the website first. The right approach depends on the situation.</p>
