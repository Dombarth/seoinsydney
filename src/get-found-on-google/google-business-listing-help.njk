            <h2>What Is a Google Business Profile?</h2>
            <p>Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is the listing that appears in Google Maps and the local section of search results. When someone searches "dentist near me" or "plumber Parramatta", the results include a map with pinned businesses and a list of local options. Those are Google Business Profile listings.</p>
            
            <p>For local businesses, this is often the most important place to appear. It's free, it's prominent, and it captures people actively looking for services in their area.</p>

<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">

            <h2>Setting Up Your Google Business Profile</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Claim or Create Your Listing</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.google.com</a> and sign in with a Google account. Search for your business name. If it already exists (Google often creates listings from various sources), claim it. If not, create a new listing.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Verify Your Business</h3>
            <p>Google needs to confirm you're authorised to manage the business. The most common method is a postcard sent to your business address with a verification code. This typically takes 5 to 14 days to arrive.</p>
            <p>Some businesses qualify for instant verification via phone or email. Video verification is also available for some business types, where you record a short video showing your business location and equipment.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 3: Complete Your Information</h3>
            <p>Fill out every section of your profile:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Business name:</strong> Use your actual business name, don't stuff keywords into it</li>
                <li><strong>Address:</strong> Your physical location, or service areas if you travel to customers</li>
                <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> Use a local number if possible, not a 1300 or 1800</li>
                <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Keep these accurate and update for holidays</li>
                <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Choose the most specific category that fits your business</li>
                <li><strong>Services:</strong> List what you offer</li>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Add photos of your business, work, and team</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 4: Get Reviews</h3>
            <p>Reviews affect your visibility in local search. Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews. Respond to all reviews, positive and negative. A professional response to a negative review can actually build trust.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 5: Post Updates</h3>
            <p>Google Business Profile lets you post updates, offers, and events. Regular posting shows your profile is active and gives you more content to appear in searches.</p>

<!-- Service Area Businesses Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>For Businesses Without a Customer-Facing Address</h2>
            <p>If you travel to customers rather than having them come to you, you can still have a Google Business Profile. This is common for trades, mobile services, and home-based businesses.</p>
            
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>You still need an address for verification (your home or office)</li>
                <li>After verification, you can hide your address</li>
                <li>You specify service areas instead (suburbs, postcodes, or radius from your location)</li>
                <li>Your listing shows "Serves [area]" instead of a specific address</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Don't use a virtual office or PO box as your address. Google can detect these and may suspend your listing.</p>

<!-- Common Problems Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Common Problems and Solutions</h2>
            
            <h3>Verification Postcard Not Arriving</h3>
            <p>If your postcard doesn't arrive after 14 days, you can request another one. Make sure your address is formatted correctly and matches what's on your building or mailbox. If you've tried multiple times, contact Google Business support directly.</p>
            
            <h3>Suspended Listing</h3>
            <p>Listings get suspended for guideline violations. Common causes include using a keyword-stuffed business name, listing a virtual office as your address, or having multiple listings for the same business. Fix the issue and submit for reinstatement.</p>
            
            <h3>Duplicate Listings</h3>
            <p>If there are multiple listings for your business, merge them. Multiple listings split your reviews and confuse customers. Mark duplicates as closed or request they be merged with your main listing.</p>
            
            <h3>Not Appearing in Local Results</h3>
            <p>Having a profile doesn't guarantee visibility. Local rankings depend on relevance, distance, and prominence. Complete your profile fully, get reviews, post regularly, and make sure your website is optimised for local search.</p>
