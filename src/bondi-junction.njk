faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For retail, hospitality, or professional services around Westfield and Oxford Street, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $2,000. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. Competition is higher in the 2022 postcode due to the concentration of commercial activity around Westfield and the Oxford Street corridor. Businesses with well-optimised Google Business Profiles can see faster initial visibility improvements."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the eastern suburbs including Bondi, Paddington, Double Bay, Woollahra, Randwick, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "The competition here is intense but the campaign was focused on the right terms. We now rank for services we had no visibility for before. The leads are from people ready to engage."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is the commercial centre of the eastern suburbs, located within the 2022 postcode. Westfield is the largest shopping centre in the area, drawing foot traffic from across the eastern suburbs and beyond. Oxford Street runs through the suburb as the primary commercial corridor, with a mix of retail, hospitality, professional services, and health practitioners. The area bus and train interchange makes it the main public transport hub for the eastern suburbs, connecting to the CBD via the T4 Eastern Suburbs line and multiple bus routes to Bondi Beach, Randwick, and surrounding suburbs.</p>

<p>The concentration of commercial activity here creates higher search competition compared to surrounding residential suburbs. Professional services firms, medical and dental practices, and retail businesses all compete for visibility when eastern suburbs residents search for services. Businesses located in or near the Westfield precinct benefit from the transport accessibility but face competition from the mall's anchor tenants and the density of surrounding commercial offerings. A structured local SEO campaign helps businesses capture search demand from the large daily population that moves through the area.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For businesses in competitive professional services or health categories, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $2,000. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
