<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide search engine optimisation for businesses in Bondi Junction and the surrounding eastern suburbs. Bondi Junction is a very different market to Bondi Beach. The area around Oxford Street Mall, the Westfield and Spring Street is a genuine commercial hub with a high concentration of medical specialists, professional services firms, retail businesses and health practitioners.</p>

<p>The medical market here is particularly competitive. Theres probably 20 to 25 dental practices within a few kilometres of Bondi Junction station and a similar number of physiotherapists, dermatologists, cosmetic clinics and allied health providers. They're all fighting for the same local search terms and the ones that have been doing SEO for a few years already have a significant advantage.</p>

<p>We started working with a dental practice just off Spring Street in 2020. They'd been operating for about six years but had never done any SEO. Their website was a template site with generic content, the Google Business Profile was incomplete and they had inconsistent business details across about 35 different directories and health listing sites. Over about ten months we rebuilt the website with individual treatment pages, fixed all the directory inconsistencies, optimised the GBP and built links from dental and health directories. They went from not appearing in the map pack at all to holding a consistent top three position for most dental searches in the eastern suburbs. They're still with us.</p>

<p>For the retail businesses around the Westfield and Oxford Street the competition comes from both local and broader Sydney searches. These businesses need to balance local SEO for foot traffic with broader search visibility for people shopping online or researching before they visit.</p>

<p>Local SEO starts from $1,200 per month. For medical and competitive industries its usually higher. Written quote before we start. No setup fees, no lock in contracts. Month to month, 30 days notice.</p>

<p>All work in house. I review every strategy personally.</p>
