<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Bondi Junction and across the eastern suburbs. We've been working with businesses around Oxford Street, Bronte Road, Spring Street, Grafton Street and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Bondi Junction has evolved into a serious commercial hub particularly with Westfield and the office towers attracting a large daytime population.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Bondi Junction is the commercial centre of the eastern suburbs with a high concentration of professional services firms, medical specialists, retail businesses and hospitality operators. Theres a large working population that comes in daily via the train and bus interchange. For businesses in Bondi Junction the competition is strong particularly in medical and professional services where multiple practices compete for the same patient and client searches. Its a suburb where the businesses that have invested in SEO consistently tend to hold their positions because the search volume is high and the intent is commercial.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a dermatology clinic near Spring Street in mid 2021 that had three dermatologists and a cosmetic nurse. They had been operating in Bondi Junction for about six years and were getting most of their patients from GP referrals which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was a basic four page site with no condition specific content and their Google Business Profile had the wrong address format. We rebuilt the site with individual condition and treatment pages, sorted out the GBP, created content targeting specific skin condition searches and built links from dermatology associations and medical directories. Over about eight months their self referred patient enquiries went from about four per month to around fifteen. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the medical content which a lot of other agencies in Bondi Junction don't write properly.</p>

<p>The retail market in Bondi Junction is dominated by Westfield but the surrounding streets have independent businesses that can compete on local searches. A specialty retailer or service business in Bondi Junction that invests in local SEO can capture the searches that Westfield tenants don't because most of the big chain stores rely on their national marketing rather than local optimisation.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Bondi Junction businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For medical specialists and dermatology practices in Bondi Junction its usually between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many conditions and treatments are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Bondi Junction business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Bondi Junction area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
