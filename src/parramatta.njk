<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Parramatta and across western Sydney. We've been working with businesses around Church Street, George Street, Macquarie Street, Smith Street and the surrounding areas since about 2015 and Parramatta has transformed significantly in that time with the light rail, the new Powerhouse Museum precinct and the ongoing CBD development changing the commercial landscape.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Parramatta is Sydneys second CBD and the commercial centre of western Sydney. Theres a massive concentration of law firms, accounting practices, migration agents, medical specialists, real estate agencies, and retail businesses. For businesses in Parramatta the competition is growing rapidly as more companies relocate from the eastern CBD. Its a market where the businesses that have invested in SEO over the past few years already hold strong positions and newcomers need a targeted strategy to compete.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a family law firm on George Street in mid 2020 that had been operating for about ten years. Three solicitors handling family law, property settlement and child custody matters. They were getting most of their clients from court referrals and legal aid work which is where most of their matters had always come from. Their website was a four page template and their Google Business Profile wasn't verified. We rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around specific family law scenarios that people in Parramatta were searching for and built links from legal directories and law society listings. Over about nine months their private client enquiries from organic search went from about two per month to around twelve. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the legal content which a lot of other agencies in this area outsource to generic copywriters.</p>

<p>The restaurant and dining market around Church Street and the Eat Street precinct in Parramatta is diverse and competitive. Theres hundreds of restaurants covering every cuisine imaginable. Most rely on foot traffic and delivery apps. A restaurant in Parramatta that invests in local SEO and GBP management can capture a significant share of the dining search traffic because the online competition is still relatively weak compared to the sheer number of options available.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Parramatta businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For law firms and professional services in Parramatta its usually between $1,800 and $2,500 depending on how many practice areas or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Parramatta clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Parramatta strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Parramatta area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
