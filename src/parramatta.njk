<h2>The Search Landscape in Parramatta</h2>

<p>Parramatta is the commercial centre of western Sydney and one of the most significant business districts outside the Sydney CBD. The area has a high concentration of law firms, migration agents, accounting practices, medical specialists and financial services firms. The development of the Parramatta Square precinct and the light rail have accelerated the area's growth as a commercial hub.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Parramatta:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Strong competition for professional services terms, particularly law and migration</li>
    <li>Growing medical and specialist health precinct</li>
    <li>Government sector generating service and compliance-related searches</li>
    <li>Hospitality competition along Church Street and Eat Street</li>
    <li>Multicultural population driving multilingual search demand</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Parramatta</h2>

<p>We worked with a migration law firm on George Street that had been operating for about eight years. They had three solicitors and a growing case load but almost no organic search visibility. Their website listed their services on a single page and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. Over about nine months we rebuilt the site with individual visa category pages, created content around the specific migration questions their potential clients were searching for, optimised the GBP and built links from legal directories and migration industry resources. They went from receiving no organic enquiries to getting a consistent flow of qualified leads each month.</p>

<p>The hospitality market along Church Street and in the Eat Street precinct is competitive for dining searches. For restaurants and cafes in Parramatta, Google Business Profile optimisation is the most immediate lever. The multicultural dining scene creates search demand across multiple languages and cuisine types.</p>
