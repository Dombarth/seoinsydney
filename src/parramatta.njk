<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Parramatta and across the greater western Sydney region. Parramatta is Sydney's second CBD and the business landscape here has changed dramatically over the past ten years. Church Street, George Street, Phillip Street and the areas around the station have attracted a massive influx of professional services, medical practices, legal firms and financial advisors.</p>

<p>The competition for search visibility in Parramatta is now comparable to parts of the city. Theres a high concentration of accountants, lawyers, migration agents and medical specialists all targeting the same local search terms. The difference is that many of these businesses are newer and haven't built the kind of online authority that established city based competitors have. That creates both an opportunity and a challenge.</p>

<p>We started working with an accounting firm on George Street in 2021. They had two partners and about six staff. Their website was a five page template site with generic content about their services. They weren't ranking for any accounting related searches in Parramatta and their Google Business Profile was barely filled in. We rebuilt the website around their specific services — tax planning, business advisory, SMSF, BAS and payroll — with individual pages for each. We optimised the GBP, fixed listing inconsistencies across about 25 directories and built links from accounting associations and local business networks. Within about eight months they were appearing on the first page for several accounting searches in the Parramatta area. They told us they were getting about ten enquiries per month from organic search compared to essentially zero before.</p>

<p>For the legal and migration agent market in Parramatta the competition is fierce. There are dozens of practices within walking distance of the station all targeting similar terms. The ones that invest consistently in SEO over 12 months or more are the ones that end up dominating. Short term campaigns don't work here.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. For competitive professional services its usually between $1,500 and $2,000. Written quote before we start. No setup fees, no lock in contracts.</p>
