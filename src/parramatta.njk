faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories such as law, migration, and accounting, campaigns typically sit between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on the number of practice areas being targeted. Pricing is based on competition level, keyword scope, and technical requirements. A written quote with a full breakdown is provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking movement within three to six months. The 2150 postcode is one of the most competitive areas in Western Sydney for professional services searches. For categories like migration law and financial planning, meaningful organic visibility typically takes six to twelve months of consistent work. Google Business Profile improvements can show results faster."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Western Sydney including Westmead, Harris Park, Granville, and the broader region. I also service businesses across the Sydney metropolitan area from the CBD to the northern beaches to the Sutherland Shire."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you decide to stop, everything stays yours including content, backlinks, and technical improvements."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area sits at the geographic centre of Greater Sydney and functions as the city's second CBD. The 2150 postcode covers a dense commercial precinct anchored by Church Street, the Square development, and a major transport interchange connecting rail, bus, and the new light rail. The area has a high concentration of law firms, migration agents, accounting practices, medical specialists, and government offices. Over half of the area's residents speak a language other than English at home, creating significant multilingual search demand.</p>

<p>Search competition here is high, particularly for professional services terms. Law firms and migration agents that have been investing in SEO for several years hold strong organic positions. For businesses entering the market or those without established search visibility, a targeted local SEO campaign focused on the local commercial district and surrounding suburbs is the most effective path to consistent organic enquiries.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1,500 to $2,200. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave, everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical improvements. Each campaign is managed directly by me with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
