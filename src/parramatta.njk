faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns start from $1, 200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories such as law, migration, and accounting, campaigns typically sit between $1, 500 and $2, 200 depending on the number of practice areas being targeted. Pricing is based on competition level, keyword scope, and technical requirements. A written quote with a full breakdown is provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking movement within three to six months. The 2150 postcode is one of the most competitive areas in Western Sydney for professional services searches. For categories like migration law and financial planning, meaningful organic visibility typically takes six to twelve months of consistent work. Google Business Profile improvements can show results faster."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Western Sydney including Westmead, Harris Park, Granville, and the broader region. I also service businesses across the Sydney metropolitan area from the CBD to the northern beaches to the Sutherland Shire."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you decide to stop, everything stays yours including content, backlinks, and technical improvements."
testimonialQuote: "This is a competitive area for our industry. The campaign focused on specific service terms rather than trying to rank for everything. That targeted approach is what worked for us."

<h2>SEO in Parramatta</h2>

<p>12 years experience doing SEO for Parramatta businesses. I am familiar with every issue there is when it comes to ranking websites in this market and know the solution for each. From law firms on Church Street to medical specialists near Westmead to retail stores in Westfield Parramatta.</p>

<p>This week alone I had three calls from businesses in Parramatta asking why their website doesnt show up when people search for their services. Two of them had been with agencies that sent work offshore. One had a Google Business Profile that wasnt even verified. These are common issues I see in this area.</p>

<p>If you are going to invest in SEO in Parramatta then I believe the most important part is understanding who your actual competitors are in search. Not the business down the street. The businesses that already rank for the terms you want. Some of these firms have been investing in SEO for five or more years. A targeted campaign focused on specific service terms works better than trying to rank for everything at once.</p>

<p>The 2150 postcode is one of the most competitive areas in Western Sydney for professional services searches. Migration agents, accountants, lawyers, medical specialists. Over half of Parramatta residents speak a language other than English at home which means multilingual search demand is significant. I have worked with businesses targeting both English and non English search terms in this area.</p>

For broader service information, see my <a href="/seo-services-sydney/">SEO services overview</a> or <a href="/local-seo/">local SEO</a> for geographic targeting.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns start from $1, 200 per month. For professional services firms in competitive categories, campaigns typically range from $1, 500 to $2, 200. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave, everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical improvements. Each campaign is managed directly by me with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>

<p>Most of my work comes through word, of, mouth. If you do good work, people tell their friends about you. Its as simple as that.</p>

<p>I am punctual with deadlines. I answer my calls. I fix issues. It may sound like basic things but surprisingly they are not typical in Sydney SEO industry.</p>
