            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We provide SEO services to businesses in Sydney. Our approach focuses on technical excellence, clear communication, and measurable outcomes.</p>
            <p>We work with businesses that understand SEO as a long-term investment rather than a quick fix. Search visibility improvements take time, and we prefer clients who are prepared for realistic timelines.</p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>Our process begins with understanding your business, current website condition, and competitive landscape. This informs a practical strategy focused on achievable improvements.</p>
            <p>We explain our recommendations in clear terms. SEO involves technical complexity, but you should understand what we're doing and why.</p>
            <p>Reporting focuses on meaningful metrics. Rankings are one factor, but traffic quality, user behaviour, and business outcomes matter more.</p>

            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Technical foundations matter.</strong> Many SEO issues stem from website problems that should be fixed before content work begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Few well-optimised pages outperform many thin pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency is essential.</strong> You should understand what we're doing and see the results.</li>
                <li><strong>No guarantees.</strong> Anyone guaranteeing specific rankings is being dishonest. We can improve your position, but search engines make the final decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> Sustainable SEO builds gradually. Shortcuts often create problems later.</li>
