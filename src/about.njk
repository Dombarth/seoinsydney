            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We provide <a href="/">SEO services to businesses in Sydney</a>. Our approach focuses on technical excellence, clear communication, and measurable outcomes.</p>
            <p>We work with businesses that understand SEO as a long-term investment rather than a quick fix. Search visibility improvements take time, and we prefer clients who are prepared for realistic timelines.</p>
            <p>Our team have been providing SEO services in Sydney for over twelve years and we work with businesses across a wide range of industries including trades, professional services, ecommerce, medical, hospitality and B2B. We also work with all major platforms including WordPress, Shopify, Wix and custom built websites.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>In House Sydney Based Team</h2>
            <p>All SEO work is carried out in house by our Sydney based team. We do not outsource content writing, link building or technical SEO work offshore which is something that a large number of SEO agencies in Sydney do regardless of what their website says.</p>
            <p>When you call us you speak to the same person who is actually working on your account.</p>
            <p>Each SEO specialist in our team manages no more than fifteen accounts at any given time. At larger SEO agencies in Sydney it's common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. We keep our client numbers manageable so that every account gets the attention it needs.</p>

<!-- How We Work Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>Our process begins with understanding your business, current website condition, and competitive landscape. This informs a practical strategy focused on achievable improvements.</p>
            <p>Before we begin any SEO campaign we carry out a full SEO audit of your website which includes a technical audit, backlink audit, on page review and keyword research. This is especially important if you've had previous SEO work done because in many cases we find low quality backlinks, spammy directory listings and in some cases actual Google penalties that the previous agency never disclosed.</p>
            <p>Reporting focuses on meaningful metrics. Every client receives a monthly report that breaks down exactly what work was carried out including keyword research, on page optimisation, link building, content writing and technical SEO. The report includes how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were.</p>

<!-- What We Believe Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Technical foundations matter.</strong> Many SEO issues stem from website problems that should be fixed before content work begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Few well-optimised pages outperform many thin pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency is essential.</strong> You should understand what we're doing and see the results. We don't believe in sending through a generic PDF with traffic graphs and no context.</li>
                <li><strong>No guarantees.</strong> Anyone guaranteeing specific rankings is being dishonest. We can improve your position, but search engines make the final decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> Sustainable SEO builds gradually. Shortcuts often create problems later. We only use white hat SEO methods and ethical link building practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Buyer intent focus.</strong> We focus on commercial intent keywords and local search terms that bring in customers who are ready to buy or make an enquiry, not vanity metrics.</li>

<!-- No Contracts Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>No Lock In Contracts</h2>
            <p>One of the most common things we hear from new clients is that they've been burned by a previous SEO agency. They were locked into a 12 month contract, they never really understood what was being done to their website and when they left nothing had changed.</p>
            <p>We do not offer lock in contracts of any kind. Our terms are month to month with 30 days notice. We stay because of results not because of a contract.</p>

<!-- Ownership Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Happens If You Leave</h2>
            <p>If you decide to stop SEO services with us at any point all work that has been done remains yours. Content we have written stays on your website. Technical improvements stay in place. Backlinks we have built do not get removed.</p>
            <p>Your Google rankings may gradually decline over time in competitive industries without ongoing SEO work but you will not lose everything overnight and we will never hold your website or content hostage. Everything we build is an asset for your business regardless of whether you continue with us or not.</p>
