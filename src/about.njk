            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We provide <a href="/">SEO services to businesses in Sydney</a>. Our approach focuses on technical excellence, clear communication, and measurable outcomes.</p>
            <p>We work with businesses that understand SEO as a long-term investment rather than a quick fix. Search visibility improvements take time, and we prefer clients who are prepared for realistic timelines.</p>
            <p>Our team have been providing SEO services in Sydney for over twelve years and we work with businesses across a wide range of industries including trades, professional services, ecommerce, medical, hospitality and B2B. We also work with all major platforms including WordPress, Shopify, Wix and custom built websites.</p>

<!-- SEO Methodology Section — NEW: Demonstrates topic-by-topic expertise depth -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Our SEO Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our approach to search engine optimisation is structured around four phases that we apply to every client regardless of industry or website size.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Phase 1 — Technical Audit and Foundation:</strong> We begin with a comprehensive crawl of your website using tools like Screaming Frog, Ahrefs and Google Search Console. This identifies indexation issues, broken links, redirect chains, duplicate content, missing meta data, slow page speeds and Core Web Vitals failures. We also audit your existing backlink profile to identify toxic links that may be suppressing your rankings. If your site has been penalised or has accumulated low quality links from a previous agency, we submit a disavow file and clean up the link profile before doing anything else.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2 — Keyword Research and Content Mapping:</strong> We conduct keyword research focused on commercial intent terms that are likely to generate actual business enquiries rather than informational traffic. We map keywords to existing pages where possible and identify content gaps where new pages are needed. Each page targets a specific search intent to avoid cannibalisation.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3 — On-Page Optimisation and Content:</strong> We optimise existing pages for their target keywords including title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, internal linking and content depth. Where new content is needed we write it in-house, ensuring it meets both search engine requirements and provides genuine value to the reader. We do not use AI-generated content without human review and editing.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 4 — Off-Page Authority and Ongoing Management:</strong> We build high quality backlinks through manual outreach, digital PR and relevant directory submissions. Link building is ongoing and focuses on relevance and authority rather than volume. We monitor rankings, traffic and conversions on a weekly basis and adjust strategy as needed based on data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

<!-- Algorithm Expertise Section — NEW: Demonstrates deep knowledge of search systems -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Staying Current With Search Algorithm Changes</h2>
            <p>Google makes thousands of changes to its search algorithms each year. Most are minor, but core updates and system changes like the Helpful Content Update, link spam updates and Discover core updates can significantly affect rankings overnight.</p>
            <p>Our team actively monitors algorithm changes and their impacts. When a core update rolls out we assess all client sites for volatility, identify any patterns in ranking changes and adjust strategies accordingly. We track these updates through Google's official blog, Search Central documentation, patent filings and analysis of ranking data across our client base.</p>
            <p>This ongoing attention to search system changes is one of the reasons we limit each specialist to fifteen accounts. Reacting quickly to algorithm changes requires time and attention that is not possible when managing forty or fifty clients.</p>

<!-- Industries Section — NEW: Demonstrates breadth of expertise -->

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Industries We Work With</h2>
            <p>Over twelve years we have developed SEO strategies for businesses across a wide range of industries. Each industry has its own competitive dynamics, search patterns and compliance considerations.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Trades and Home Services:</strong> Plumbers, electricians, builders, landscapers and similar service-area businesses. These campaigns focus heavily on <a href="/local-seo">local SEO</a> and "near me" search terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Services:</strong> Lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, consultants. These industries are competitive and require careful attention to E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical and Health:</strong> Dentists, physiotherapists, GPs, specialists. Medical SEO requires compliance with YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) guidelines and careful content accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecommerce:</strong> Online retailers on Shopify, WooCommerce and custom platforms. Ecommerce SEO involves product page optimisation, category structure, technical SEO at scale and managing large crawl budgets.</li>
                <li><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels. Heavy focus on local search visibility, Google Business Profile and review management.</li>
                <li><strong>B2B:</strong> Business-to-business services including SaaS, manufacturing and wholesale. These campaigns typically target longer sales cycles with informational and consideration-stage content.</li>

<!-- In House Team Section -->

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>In House Sydney Based Team</h2>
            <p>All SEO work is carried out in house by our Sydney based team. We do not outsource content writing, link building or technical SEO work offshore which is something that a large number of SEO agencies in Sydney do regardless of what their website says.</p>
            <p>When you call us you speak to the same person who is actually working on your account.</p>
            <p>Each SEO specialist in our team manages no more than fifteen accounts at any given time. At larger SEO agencies in Sydney it's common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. We keep our client numbers manageable so that every account gets the attention it needs.</p>

<!-- How We Work Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>Our process begins with understanding your business, current website condition, and competitive landscape. This informs a practical strategy focused on achievable improvements.</p>
            <p>Before we begin any SEO campaign we carry out a full SEO audit of your website which includes a technical audit, backlink audit, on page review and keyword research. This is especially important if you've had previous SEO work done because in many cases we find low quality backlinks, spammy directory listings and in some cases actual Google penalties that the previous agency never disclosed.</p>
            <p>Reporting focuses on meaningful metrics. Every client receives a monthly report that breaks down exactly what work was carried out including keyword research, on page optimisation, link building, content writing and technical SEO. The report includes how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were.</p>

            <p>We work across all major CMS platforms and use industry-standard tools for analysis and reporting.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Technical foundations matter.</strong> Many SEO issues stem from website problems that should be fixed before content work begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality over quantity.</strong> Few well-optimised pages outperform many thin pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency is essential.</strong> You should understand what we're doing and see the results. We don't believe in sending through a generic PDF with traffic graphs and no context.</li>
                <li><strong>No guarantees.</strong> Anyone guaranteeing specific rankings is being dishonest. We can improve your position, but search engines make the final decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> Sustainable SEO builds gradually. Shortcuts often create problems later. We only use white hat SEO methods and ethical link building practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Buyer intent focus.</strong> We focus on commercial intent keywords and local search terms that bring in customers who are ready to buy or make an enquiry, not vanity metrics.</li>
            </ul>

<!-- No Contracts Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>No Lock In Contracts</h2>
            <p>One of the most common things we hear from new clients is that they've been burned by a previous SEO agency. They were locked into a 12 month contract, they never really understood what was being done to their website and when they left nothing had changed.</p>
            <p>We do not offer lock in contracts of any kind. Our terms are month to month with 30 days notice. We stay because of results not because of a contract.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Happens If You Leave</h2>
            <p>If you decide to stop SEO services with us at any point all work that has been done remains yours. Content we have written stays on your website. Technical improvements stay in place. Backlinks we have built do not get removed.</p>
            <p>Your Google rankings may gradually decline over time in competitive industries without ongoing SEO work but you will not lose everything overnight and we will never hold your website or content hostage. Everything we build is an asset for your business regardless of whether you continue with us or not.</p>
