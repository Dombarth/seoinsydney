<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Manly and across the northern beaches. Manly operates almost like its own town. The Corso, the beachfront, the wharf area and the streets around Pittwater Road have a concentrated commercial centre that serves both locals and a massive volume of tourists and day trippers. That dual audience creates a unique search environment.</p>

<p>Tourism driven businesses — surf schools, restaurants, accommodation, activities — compete for searches from people who don't live locally. They need to be visible for broader searches like things to do in Manly or restaurants near Manly Beach. Local service businesses — plumbers, electricians, dentists, physios — compete for the residential population searching for nearby providers. Both require different SEO approaches.</p>

<p>We started working with a restaurant on the Corso in early 2022. They'd been operating for about six years and did well from foot traffic but their online bookings were minimal. The website was outdated, the GBP had limited photos and inconsistent hours and they had poor visibility for any restaurant related searches in the area. We rebuilt the website with proper menu pages, optimised the GBP with regular photo updates and review management and built links from food directories and northern beaches community sites. Within about five months they were showing in the map pack for most restaurant and dining searches in Manly. The owner said weeknight bookings which had always been slow improved noticeably and they were getting tables from people searching specifically rather than just walking past.</p>

<p>For the trades and home services businesses in Manly the northern beaches market is quite contained. People here tend to search for services within their area rather than looking across Sydney. A plumber or electrician that ranks well for northern beaches searches captures a loyal customer base.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month with 30 days notice.</p>
