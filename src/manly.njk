<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Manly and across the northern beaches. We've been working with businesses around The Corso, Sydney Road, Belgrave Street, Pittwater Road and the surrounding areas since about 2016 and Manly has always been a unique market because of the split between local residents and the massive tourism traffic that comes through the ferry and bus interchange.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Manly is one of the most searched suburbs in Sydney because of its beach and tourism appeal. Theres a dense concentration of surf schools, restaurants, cafes, bars, accommodation providers, wellness practitioners and retail businesses all within a compact area. For businesses in Manly the challenge is similar to Bondi in that search intent splits between tourist activities and local services. Its a suburb where understanding which searches to target makes the difference between attracting tourists who are passing through and local customers who will come back regularly.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a surf school operating off Manly Beach in mid 2021 that had been running for about seven years. Two instructors and a seasonal team during summer. They were getting most of their bookings through Tripadvisor and walk ups which is where most of their revenue had always come from. Their website was a single page with a booking widget and their Google Business Profile had outdated photos and no posts. We rebuilt the site with pages for group lessons, private lessons and corporate events, created content around surfing conditions and visitor information, sorted out the GBP with seasonal photos and regular posts and built links from tourism directories and surfing publications. Over about six months their direct bookings through the website went from about ten per week to around thirty. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house which a lot of other agencies on the northern beaches don't really do for tourism businesses.</p>

<p>The dining market along The Corso and the beachfront in Manly is intensely competitive. Most restaurants rely on location and foot traffic. A restaurant in Manly that invests in local SEO and GBP management can capture the planning searches that tourists and day trippers make before they arrive on the ferry.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Manly businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For tourism and hospitality businesses in Manly its usually between $1,400 and $2,000 depending on how competitive the category is. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Manly business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Manly area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
