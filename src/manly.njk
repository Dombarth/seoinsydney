  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality venues on The Corso or surf and lifestyle businesses in the area, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2095 postcode has above-average competition for hospitality and tourism categories. Seasonal demand peaks during summer create additional ranking opportunities for businesses with strong search foundations."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the Northern Beaches including Dee Why, Brookvale, Freshwater, Fairlight, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."
testimonialQuote: "Tourism means our search landscape is unique. The campaign separated our service-based keywords from the tourist noise. We now rank for the terms that bring in actual local customers."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a beachside suburb within the 2095 postcode on the Northern Beaches peninsula, accessible by ferry from Circular Quay across Sydney Harbour. The Corso, a pedestrian mall connecting the ferry wharf at the Cove to the beach, is the primary commercial and retail strip. The suburb draws a mix of residents, commuters, tourists, and day-trippers, creating diverse search demand patterns throughout the year. the beach, Shelly Beach, and the coastal walks to North Head and the Spit Bridge are significant visitor attractions that supplement the local residential demand for services.</p>

<p>The tourism and visitor component of the area's economy creates seasonal search demand that peaks during warmer months. Hospitality businesses, surf schools, accommodation providers, and experience-based businesses compete for visitor-driven searches alongside the year-round local residential demand. For businesses serving the residential population, including trades, health services, and professional services, the area's peninsula geography creates a natural local market. Residents tend to search for services within the Northern Beaches rather than travelling to other parts of Sydney, making local SEO particularly effective for businesses targeting this catchment.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For hospitality and tourism businesses on The Corso or the beachfront, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
