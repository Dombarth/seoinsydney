We have been working with businesses along The Corso, Belgrave Street, Pittwater Road and the surrounding beachfront precinct since 2016.

<h2>The Search Landscape in Manly</h2>

<p>Manly's search demand is driven by a combination of local residents, day-trip visitors and tourists. The business mix includes hospitality venues, accommodation providers, surf and activity businesses, health practitioners, retail shops and professional services. The ferry connection to the CBD creates a commuter population that also drives local search activity.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Strong tourism and visitor search demand throughout the year</li>
    <li>Dense hospitality competition along The Corso and beachfront</li>
    <li>Accommodation providers competing for travel and booking searches</li>
    <li>Health, fitness and wellness businesses serving the local population</li>
    <li>Seasonal variations in search volume with peaks in warmer months</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Manly</h2>

<p>We worked with a surf school that had been operating on Manly Beach for about six years. They had a strong reputation among locals but were not appearing in search results when tourists searched for surf lessons. Their website was a single page with pricing and a booking button but no content explaining the experience, location or what to expect. Over about four months we rebuilt the site with content targeting the searches visitors were making, optimised the Google Business Profile with photos, activity descriptions and regular posts, and built citations across tourism and activity directories. The business saw a significant increase in bookings from people who found them through search.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses along The Corso, Google Business Profile optimisation is the primary lever. Review volume, photo quality and correct categories are especially important in a tourist area where visitors rely heavily on search to choose where to eat.</p>

    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and management</li>
