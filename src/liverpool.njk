faqs:
  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2170 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. The area's large population generates strong search volume, particularly for health, legal, and trade services."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across South Western Sydney including Bankstown, Fairfield, Campbelltown, Casula, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is the regional centre for South Western Sydney within the 2170 postcode. The local CBD is a designated strategic centre under the Greater Sydney Region Plan, with significant government, health, education, and commercial infrastructure. Westfield is the primary shopping destination, and Macquarie Street forms the main commercial strip with retail, dining, professional services, and government offices. The local hospital is one of the largest hospitals in NSW, generating a concentration of specialist and allied health services. The local station on the T2 and T5 lines provides rail connections to the CBD, Parramatta, and Campbelltown.</p>

<p>The area's strategic centre designation and the investment in infrastructure including the Western Sydney International Airport at Badgerys Creek position the suburb for significant future growth. The large and diverse population across the LGA generates strong search demand across all service categories. Professional services, health practitioners, trades businesses, and hospitality venues all compete for visibility in a market where many businesses have not yet invested in structured SEO. For businesses in the local CBD, local SEO captures enquiries from a broad regional catchment that includes Casula, Moorebank, Green Valley, and surrounding suburbs.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
