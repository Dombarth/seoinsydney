<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Liverpool and across south western Sydney. We've been working with businesses around Macquarie Street, George Street, Elizabeth Street, Moore Street and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Liverpool has been growing rapidly as a major regional centre with the hospital expansion, university campus and ongoing CBD development.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Liverpool is the commercial and civic centre of south western Sydney with a large and diverse population catchment. Theres a major concentration of medical specialists around Liverpool Hospital, a growing number of legal firms, migration agents, accounting practices and real estate agencies along with a busy retail and hospitality scene. For businesses in Liverpool the search volume is significant because the suburb serves as the main hub for a population of over half a million people in the surrounding area. Its a market where the gap between businesses with SEO and those without is enormous.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a personal injury law firm near Macquarie Street in mid 2021 that had been operating for about eight years. Three solicitors handling motor vehicle accidents, workplace injuries and public liability claims. They were getting most of their clients from referrals and legal aid panels which is where most of their cases had always come from. Their website was outdated and their Google Business Profile was under the wrong category. We rebuilt the site with individual practice area pages, created content around common compensation and injury claim topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from legal directories and law society listings. Over about nine months their organic enquiries from private clients went from about two per month to around eleven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the legal content which a lot of other agencies in south western Sydney outsource.</p>

<p>The medical specialist market around Liverpool Hospital is growing rapidly. Surgeons, physicians and allied health practitioners who establish strong online visibility early in Liverpool can build substantial patient bases from the broader south western Sydney population that uses Liverpool as their primary medical hub.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Liverpool businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For legal firms and medical specialists in Liverpool its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many practice areas or specialties are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Liverpool business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Liverpool area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
