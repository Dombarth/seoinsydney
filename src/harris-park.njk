<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Harris Park and across the Parramatta area. We've been working with businesses around Wigram Street, Station Street, Marion Street and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Harris Park has established itself as a well known dining destination particularly for Indian and South Asian cuisine.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Harris Park is a compact suburb with a strong identity built around its restaurant strip on Wigram Street. Theres a high concentration of Indian restaurants, sweet shops, grocery stores and related retail businesses along with a growing number of professional services firms and migration agents. For businesses in Harris Park the competition within the dining category is intense because theres so many restaurants in such a small area. Its a suburb where the businesses that invest in online visibility tend to attract customers from across Sydney not just locals because people travel specifically to Harris Park for the food.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We started working with an Indian restaurant on Wigram Street in mid 2021 that had been running for about four years. Good food and decent reviews but they were losing ground to newer restaurants opening up on the same strip which is where most of their frustration came from. Their website was a single page with a menu PDF and their Google Business Profile had outdated photos and no posts. We rebuilt the site with a proper online ordering system, created content around their cuisine style and catering services, sorted out the GBP with professional photos and regular posts and built links from food blogs and restaurant directories. Over about six months their direct orders through the website went from almost nothing to about twenty five per week and their overall foot traffic increased noticeably. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house which a lot of other agencies around Harris Park don't bother with for restaurant clients.</p>

<p>The professional services market in Harris Park is growing as the suburb benefits from its proximity to the Parramatta CBD. Migration agents, accountants and tax agents serving the local community can benefit from local SEO because the search behaviour in Harris Park tends to be language and community specific which creates opportunities for targeted campaigns.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Harris Park businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For restaurants wanting to target broader Sydney wide searches its usually between $1,400 and $1,800 depending on the scope. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Harris Park business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Harris Park area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
