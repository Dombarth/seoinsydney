<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Harris Park across the areas of hospitality, retail and professional services. Harris Park has a distinctive identity within the Parramatta area. Wigram Street is one of the most well known restaurant strips in western Sydney and the Indian restaurant scene here attracts diners from across the entire metropolitan area.</p>

<p>The restaurant businesses on Wigram Street operate in an interesting search environment. People don't just search for food in Harris Park — they search for Indian food in Sydney, Indian restaurants near Parramatta, specific dishes and specific dining occasions. The businesses that optimise for this broader set of searches are the ones capturing customers from outside the immediate area.</p>

<p>We started working with an Indian restaurant on Wigram Street in mid 2021. They'd been operating for about seven years and had a loyal customer base but their online presence was a mess. Three duplicate Google Business Profiles, an outdated website that wasn't mobile friendly, inconsistent information across food directories and review sites. They were losing potential customers to competitors who had cleaner online presence despite serving arguably worse food. We consolidated the GBP listings, rebuilt the website with proper menu pages, optimised for the key cuisine and location searches and cleaned up about 20 directory listings. Within about six months they were showing in the map pack for most Indian restaurant searches in the Parramatta area. The owner told us Friday and Saturday bookings increased noticeably and they were getting more corporate catering enquiries from people who found them through search.</p>

<p>Beyond hospitality Harris Park also has a growing number of professional services businesses including migration agents, tax agents and community service organisations. These businesses tend to serve the local multicultural community and benefit from SEO that targets both English and culturally specific search terms.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
