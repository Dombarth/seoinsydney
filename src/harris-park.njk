  - q: "How much does SEO cost for a local business?"
    a: "Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For restaurants on Wigram Street or professional services in the area, campaigns typically sit between $1,200 and $1,800. Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2150 postcode overlaps with Parramatta, which has higher competition for some categories. Businesses in niche categories like South Asian dining or specialist retail can see results faster."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across Western Sydney including Parramatta, Westmead, Granville, Rosehill, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a small suburb within the 2150 postcode, immediately adjacent to Parramatta CBD. The suburb is widely known for its Indian and South Asian dining precinct along Wigram Street, which has become one of Sydney's recognised food destinations. The street draws diners from across Greater Sydney, not just the immediate Parramatta area. The area is also connected to Parramatta's commercial and transport infrastructure, with the area train station on the T1 Western Line and walking distance to Parramatta Station and the Parramatta CBD.</p>

<p>The dining precinct on Wigram Street creates concentrated search demand for cuisine-specific queries. Indian restaurants, South Asian grocery stores, sweet shops, and catering businesses compete for visibility in a niche where Google Business Profile rankings, reviews, and photo quality directly influence customer decisions. For businesses outside the dining precinct, including trades, professional services, and retail, search competition here is moderate. The suburb's proximity to Parramatta means local searches often overlap with Parramatta results, and a structured SEO campaign needs to account for this overlap.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. For restaurants on Wigram Street or businesses in competitive dining categories, campaigns typically range from $1,200 to $1,800. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
