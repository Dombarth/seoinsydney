<h2>The Search Landscape in Harris Park</h2>

<p>Harris Park is known across Sydney for its Indian restaurant precinct along Wigram Street. Beyond the dining scene, the suburb has a mix of retail shops, professional services, migration agents and local service businesses serving both the local community and the broader Parramatta area.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Harris Park:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High concentration of Indian restaurants creating intense competition for cuisine-specific searches</li>
    <li>Migration and professional services targeting the multicultural community</li>
    <li>Overlap with Parramatta searches for many service categories</li>
    <li>Retail businesses along the main commercial strips</li>
    <li>Growing residential development creating new local service demand</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Harris Park</h2>

<p>We worked with an Indian restaurant on Wigram Street that had been operating for about five years. They had good foot traffic but were not appearing in Google search results when people searched for Indian food near Parramatta. Their Google Business Profile was set up under a generic restaurant category rather than the specific Indian cuisine category, and their website was a single page with a menu PDF. Over about four months we optimised the GBP with correct categories, proper service descriptions, high-quality photos and regular posting. We also rebuilt the website with a proper menu page, an about page and content targeting the specific cuisine searches people were making. The restaurant moved into the map pack for key dining searches and saw an increase in orders from people who found them through search.</p>

<p>For professional services businesses in Harris Park, the approach focuses on both local and Parramatta-wide search visibility. Many accounting firms, migration agents and service providers in the area serve clients from across western Sydney, so the Google Business Profile service area and content targeting need to reflect that broader reach.</p>
