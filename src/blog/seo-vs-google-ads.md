## How Search Results Work

When someone searches on Google, the results page typically contains two types of listings: paid advertisements (Google Ads) and organic results. Paid results appear at the top and bottom of the page and are labelled "Sponsored." Organic results appear between these and are determined by Google's ranking algorithm.

Both channels can generate traffic, leads, and sales. They work differently, cost differently, and produce results on different timelines. Most businesses benefit from understanding both before deciding how to allocate their marketing budget.

## How SEO Works

SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is the process of improving a website so that it ranks higher in organic search results. This involves:

- **Technical optimisation:** Improving site speed, mobile usability, crawlability, and structured data
- **Content development:** Creating pages that thoroughly address the topics and queries your customers search for
- **Link building:** Earning backlinks from other reputable websites to build domain authority
- **On-page optimisation:** Ensuring title tags, meta descriptions, headings, and internal links are structured effectively

SEO does not involve paying Google for placement. The traffic generated by SEO is often referred to as "free" traffic, though this is misleading because there is a cost associated with the work required to achieve and maintain rankings.

## How Google Ads Works

Google Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising platform. Advertisers bid on keywords and pay a fee each time someone clicks on their ad. The cost per click varies based on competition for the keyword and the quality score of the ad.

Google Ads provides immediate visibility. An ad can appear at the top of search results within hours of being set up. However, traffic stops immediately when the advertising budget is paused or depleted.

Google Ads campaigns involve:

- **Keyword selection:** Choosing which search terms to bid on
- **Ad copywriting:** Creating the text that appears in the advertisement
- **Landing page optimisation:** Ensuring the page users arrive on is relevant and designed to convert
- **Bid management:** Setting and adjusting how much to pay per click
- **Budget management:** Controlling daily and monthly spending

## Direct Comparison

### Cost Structure

**SEO:** Monthly retainer fee for ongoing work. No cost per click or per visitor. The investment is in the work itself (content, technical improvements, link building), not in the traffic it generates. Typical costs range from $1,200 to $10,000+ per month depending on competition and scope.

**Google Ads:** Cost per click that varies by keyword. Competitive keywords in industries like legal, finance, and insurance can cost $20 to $80+ per click. A monthly budget of $2,000 to $10,000+ is common, plus management fees if using an agency.

### Timeline

**SEO:** Three to six months for initial results. Six to twelve months for significant organic traffic growth. SEO is a medium to long-term investment.

**Google Ads:** Immediate. Ads can appear within hours of campaign launch. Results are visible from day one, though optimisation to improve efficiency typically takes two to four weeks.

### Sustainability

**SEO:** Traffic continues after the work is done. Content remains published, technical improvements persist, and backlinks continue to pass authority. While rankings may eventually decline without ongoing maintenance, the assets built through SEO have lasting value.

**Google Ads:** Traffic stops when spending stops. There is no residual benefit from previous advertising spend. Each visitor requires a new payment.

### Click-Through Rates

Research consistently shows that organic results receive a higher percentage of clicks than paid results. Many users skip past the "Sponsored" listings and click on organic results. However, for highly commercial queries, Google Ads can capture users who are ready to take action immediately.

### Trust Perception

Some users view organic results as more trustworthy than paid advertisements. Appearing in organic results implies that Google has evaluated the page and deemed it relevant, whereas a paid ad simply means the advertiser has paid for visibility. This distinction varies by audience and industry.

### Targeting Precision

**SEO:** Targeting is based on optimising for specific search queries. You can target keywords, topics, and geographic areas, but you have less control over exactly who sees your listing.

**Google Ads:** Offers precise targeting by keyword, location, device, time of day, audience demographics, and remarketing lists. This level of control is useful for reaching specific customer segments.

## When SEO Is the Appropriate Choice

SEO tends to be the appropriate primary channel when:

- **Budget efficiency matters:** You want to reduce cost per acquisition over time. SEO becomes more cost-effective as traffic grows without proportional cost increases.
- **Long-term growth is the priority:** You are building a business asset that will generate traffic for years, not weeks.
- **Your market is research-oriented:** Your customers research before purchasing and are likely to click on organic results.
- **Local visibility is important:** Local SEO combined with Google Business Profile optimisation is highly effective for service-area businesses.
- **You want to build authority:** SEO content establishes your business as a reference source in your industry.

## When Google Ads Is the Appropriate Choice

Google Ads tends to be the appropriate primary channel when:

- **Immediate results are needed:** You need leads or sales now and cannot wait three to six months for SEO to take effect.
- **Testing new markets:** You want to test demand for a new product or service before investing in long-term SEO.
- **Seasonal businesses:** You need to capture demand during specific periods and scale back during quiet times.
- **Highly competitive organic results:** The organic results are dominated by large, established competitors and breaking in will take a long time.
- **Precise targeting is required:** You need to reach specific audience segments based on demographics, location, or behaviour.

## Using Both Channels Together

For many businesses the most effective approach is using both SEO and Google Ads together. This provides:

- **Immediate traffic from ads** while SEO builds over time
- **Data from ads** that informs SEO keyword strategy (which keywords convert, which have high commercial value)
- **Dual visibility** in search results, increasing the likelihood of a click
- **Reduced ad spend over time** as organic rankings improve and capture traffic that previously required paid clicks

A common approach is to invest heavily in Google Ads during the first six months while SEO is being established, then gradually shift budget from ads to SEO maintenance as organic traffic grows.

## Cost Comparison Example

Consider a business targeting keywords with an average cost per click of $10 in Google Ads.

**Google Ads only:**
- 200 clicks per month × $10 = $2,000 in ad spend
- Plus agency management fee of $500 to $1,000
- Total monthly cost: $2,500 to $3,000
- Annual cost: $30,000 to $36,000
- If ads are paused, traffic drops to zero

**SEO only:**
- Monthly retainer: $2,000 to $3,000
- Months 1-6: Limited organic traffic while rankings build
- Months 6-12: Organic traffic growing, potentially exceeding 200 visitors per month
- Year 2 onwards: Continued traffic with maintained or reduced investment
- If SEO is paused, traffic declines gradually rather than stopping immediately

**Combined approach:**
- Google Ads: $1,500 per month (reduced budget)
- SEO: $2,000 per month
- Total: $3,500 per month
- By month 6-12, organic traffic supplements paid traffic
- By year 2, organic may handle the majority of traffic and ad spend can be reduced further

## Summary

SEO and Google Ads serve different purposes and work on different timelines. SEO builds long-term traffic assets that compound over time. Google Ads provides immediate, controllable traffic that stops when spending stops.

Neither channel is inherently superior. The appropriate choice depends on the business's timeline, budget, competitive landscape, and growth objectives. Most businesses benefit from a considered combination of both.
