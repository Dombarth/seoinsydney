## Why This Decision Matters

Choosing an SEO agency is a business decision with long-term consequences. A competent agency can significantly increase organic traffic, leads, and revenue over twelve to twenty-four months. A poor choice can waste budget, damage your website's standing with search engines, and set back your online visibility by months or years.

The Australian SEO market includes a wide range of providers, from solo consultants to large agencies, with varying levels of competence, transparency, and ethical standards. Understanding what to evaluate helps businesses avoid common mistakes.

## What to Evaluate

### Transparency of Process

A reputable SEO agency should be able to clearly explain:

- What work they will do each month
- How they will report on that work
- Which tools they use and why
- How they build links and what types of links they build
- How they create content and who writes it
- What metrics they track and how they define success

If an agency describes their process as proprietary or refuses to explain their methods in detail, that is a concern. SEO is not a secret formula. It involves well-documented practices that any legitimate provider should be willing to discuss openly.

### Reporting Quality

Monthly reporting should include:

- **Work completed:** A detailed list of what was done, not vague summaries
- **Hours allocated:** How time was spent across different activities
- **Keyword tracking:** Position changes for target keywords
- **Traffic data:** Organic sessions, pages, and trends
- **Conversion data:** Leads, calls, form submissions, or sales from organic search
- **Technical health:** Any issues identified and resolved
- **Next month plan:** What work is planned for the upcoming period

Reports that only contain traffic graphs without context or explanation of the work done provide insufficient accountability.

### Team Structure

Understanding who will actually work on your account matters.

- **Dedicated account manager:** Will you have a single point of contact who understands your business?
- **Account load:** How many clients does each team member manage? Fifteen to twenty is reasonable. Forty to fifty means each account receives minimal attention.
- **In-house vs outsourced:** Is the work done by the agency's own team or outsourced to third parties? Content writing and link building are commonly outsourced offshore, sometimes without the client's knowledge.
- **Specialisation:** Does the team include specialists in technical SEO, content, and link building, or does one generalist handle everything?

### Industry Experience

While SEO principles are consistent across industries, experience in your specific sector is valuable. An agency that has worked with medical practices, for example, understands AHPRA advertising regulations and YMYL content standards that a generalist might not.

Ask whether the agency has worked with businesses similar to yours and what results they achieved.

### Contract Terms

Common contract structures in the Australian SEO market include:

- **Month-to-month:** Either party can end the engagement with notice (typically 30 days). This provides maximum flexibility and accountability.
- **Three-month minimum:** A short commitment period that gives the agency time to complete initial setup and begin showing progress.
- **Six to twelve months:** Longer commitments that may come with lower monthly rates but reduce your ability to change direction if results are not materialising.

Longer contracts are not inherently problematic, but they should be evaluated carefully. If an agency requires a twelve-month contract and cannot explain why, that warrants scrutiny.

### Pricing and Value

SEO pricing varies significantly across the Australian market. Understanding what is included at each price point is more important than the price itself.

Key questions about pricing:

- What is included in the monthly fee?
- Are there setup fees or onboarding costs?
- What happens if additional work is needed outside the agreed scope?
- How are price increases handled?
- Is there a minimum contract term?

Comparing agencies purely on price often leads to poor decisions. A $1,500 per month agency that delivers measurable results is better value than an $800 per month agency that produces no meaningful outcomes.

## Questions to Ask During Evaluation

### About Their Approach

- How do you conduct keyword research and how do you decide which keywords to target?
- What is your link building strategy and can you provide examples of links you have built for other clients?
- How do you approach content creation? Who writes the content?
- What technical SEO work do you include in your service?
- How do you handle Google algorithm updates?

### About Results and Accountability

- Can you show examples of organic traffic growth for similar businesses?
- How do you measure success and what KPIs do you track?
- What happens if rankings drop?
- How long before we should expect to see results?
- What does your monthly reporting include?

### About the Working Relationship

- Who will be our main point of contact?
- How many other clients does our account manager handle?
- How often will we communicate (calls, emails, meetings)?
- What access do you need to our website and analytics?
- What is the process if we want to make changes to the strategy?

### About Ownership and Exit

- Who owns the content you create?
- What happens to backlinks if we end the contract?
- Do we retain access to all analytics and reporting data?
- Is there an exit process or handover procedure?

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Guaranteed Rankings

No SEO provider can guarantee specific rankings. Google's algorithm is controlled by Google and considers hundreds of factors that no external party can fully control. Any guarantee of "page one" or "number one" rankings should be treated with scepticism.

### Unusually Low Pricing

SEO services below $500 per month from an agency (not a solo freelancer working on a small scope) typically indicate one of two things: the work is being outsourced to very low-cost providers, or the scope of work is so limited that it will not produce meaningful results.

### Lack of Communication

An agency that is difficult to reach during the sales process will not become more communicative after you sign a contract. Responsiveness during the evaluation phase is a reliable indicator of what to expect during the engagement.

### Vague Descriptions of Work

Phrases like "we'll optimise your website" or "we'll build your online presence" without specific detail about what activities are included should prompt follow-up questions. Every element of the work should be explainable in concrete terms.

### Ownership Restrictions

Some agencies retain ownership of content they create, backlinks they build, or even the website itself. If you cannot take your assets with you when the relationship ends, you are not building long-term business value.

### Private Blog Networks

Private Blog Networks (PBNs) are networks of websites created solely for the purpose of building links. Google considers this a link scheme and websites caught using PBNs can receive manual penalties. Any mention of PBNs or link networks should be treated as a disqualifying factor.

### No Interest in Your Business

An agency that jumps straight to pricing without asking about your business, your customers, your goals, and your competitive landscape is unlikely to develop a strategy tailored to your needs.

## How to Make the Decision

After evaluating multiple agencies, consider the following:

1. **Clarity:** Which agency gave the clearest, most specific explanation of what they would do?
2. **Understanding:** Which agency asked the most informed questions about your business?
3. **Transparency:** Which agency was most willing to explain their process, team structure, and reporting?
4. **Realism:** Which agency set the most realistic expectations about timelines and outcomes?
5. **Fit:** Which agency felt like the right cultural and communication fit for how you want to work?

The right agency is one that reduces your uncertainty about what will happen with your SEO investment. They explain clearly, report thoroughly, and set expectations honestly.

## Summary

Choosing an SEO agency requires evaluating transparency, reporting quality, team structure, contract terms, and communication standards. The decision should be based on clarity of process and realistic expectations rather than promises of rapid results or the lowest price.

Taking time to evaluate properly and asking the right questions upfront significantly reduces the risk of a poor outcome.
