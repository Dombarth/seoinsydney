## SEO Pricing Overview

The cost of SEO in Australia varies widely depending on the scope of work, the competitiveness of the industry, and the experience of the provider. There is no single price that applies to all businesses, but there are common pricing structures and ranges that most providers fall within.

This guide covers the main pricing models, typical cost ranges, and the factors that influence what a business should expect to pay.

## Common Pricing Models

### Monthly Retainer

The most common pricing model for ongoing SEO services is a monthly retainer. The business pays a fixed monthly fee and the SEO provider delivers an agreed scope of work each month. This typically includes a combination of technical SEO, content creation, link building, and reporting.

Monthly retainers provide consistency for both the business and the provider. SEO is an ongoing process and a retainer structure reflects the continuous nature of the work.

### Project-Based Pricing

Some SEO work is better suited to a fixed project scope. Common project-based engagements include SEO audits, website migrations, site architecture planning, and one-off technical fixes. The cost is agreed upfront based on the defined scope of work.

Project-based pricing works well when the requirements are clearly defined and have a natural endpoint.

### Hourly Consulting

SEO consultants may charge by the hour for advisory work, training, or ad hoc technical assistance. Hourly rates in Australia typically range from $150 to $350 per hour depending on the consultant's experience and specialisation.

This model suits businesses that have internal marketing teams and need expert guidance rather than full-service delivery.

## Typical SEO Cost Ranges in Australia

The following ranges represent what most Australian businesses will encounter when seeking SEO services. These are indicative figures based on market conditions as of 2026.

### Small Business and Local SEO

- **Monthly retainer:** $1,000 to $2,500 per month
- **Typical scope:** Local keyword targeting, Google Business Profile optimisation, on-page SEO, basic link building, monthly reporting
- **Suitable for:** Trades, local services, single-location businesses, small professional practices

Local SEO campaigns target a specific geographic area and typically involve fewer keywords and less content production than broader campaigns. The lower cost reflects the reduced scope rather than lower quality work.

### Mid-Market and Regional Businesses

- **Monthly retainer:** $2,500 to $5,000 per month
- **Typical scope:** Multi-location targeting, competitive keyword research, ongoing content production, quality link building, technical SEO monitoring, detailed monthly reporting
- **Suitable for:** Multi-location businesses, competitive local markets, growing ecommerce stores, professional services firms

At this level the SEO provider is typically managing a larger keyword set and producing more content. Link building becomes more targeted and may include digital PR activities.

### Competitive Industries and National Campaigns

- **Monthly retainer:** $5,000 to $15,000+ per month
- **Typical scope:** National keyword targeting, large-scale content strategy, advanced technical SEO, competitive link building, conversion rate optimisation, comprehensive reporting and analytics
- **Suitable for:** National brands, competitive ecommerce, finance, insurance, real estate, legal services

Highly competitive industries require significantly more resources to achieve and maintain rankings. The cost reflects the volume of content, the difficulty of link acquisition, and the ongoing technical requirements.

### SEO Audits

- **One-off cost:** $1,500 to $5,000
- **Typical scope:** Technical audit, on-page review, backlink analysis, keyword gap analysis, competitor benchmarking, prioritised recommendations

An SEO audit is often the first step before commencing an ongoing campaign. Some providers include the audit as part of the onboarding process while others charge separately.

## Factors That Influence SEO Cost

### Industry Competitiveness

The more competitive the search landscape, the more work is required to rank. An electrician targeting a single suburb faces less competition than a law firm targeting national terms. The level of competition directly affects how much content needs to be produced, how many links need to be built, and how long the campaign takes to produce results.

### Current Website Condition

A website with existing technical problems, poor content, or toxic backlinks requires remediation before forward progress can be made. This additional work increases the initial cost. Conversely, a well-built website with some existing authority will typically see results faster and may require a lower ongoing investment.

### Number of Target Keywords

Targeting three to five local keywords requires less work than targeting fifty competitive national keywords. More keywords means more content pages, more link building, and more ongoing monitoring.

### Content Requirements

Some industries require significant content production to rank competitively. Medical, legal, and financial sectors in particular need high-quality, well-researched content that demonstrates expertise. Content production is one of the most resource-intensive parts of SEO.

### Geographic Scope

A business targeting a single suburb or city will pay less than one targeting multiple cities or the entire country. Each additional location typically requires its own content and local optimisation.

### Provider Experience and Team Structure

Agencies with larger teams, more experience, and established processes typically charge more than freelancers or smaller operations. The cost difference often reflects the depth of expertise, the range of services included, and the level of reporting and communication.

## What to Watch For in SEO Pricing

### Unusually Low Prices

SEO providers offering full-service campaigns for under $500 per month are unlikely to deliver meaningful results. At that price point the work typically involves automated reporting, minimal content, and low-quality link building that can harm rather than help rankings.

### Lock-In Contracts

Long-term contracts of six to twelve months are common in the industry but should be evaluated carefully. Some providers use lock-in contracts to retain clients even when results are not being delivered. Month-to-month arrangements provide more flexibility and accountability.

### Lack of Transparency

If a provider cannot clearly explain what work they will do each month and how they will report on it, that is a concern. Legitimate SEO work can be documented and reported on in detail.

### Guaranteed Rankings

No SEO provider can guarantee specific rankings. Google's algorithm considers hundreds of factors, many of which are outside any provider's control. Providers who guarantee first page rankings are either being dishonest or are using tactics that carry risk.

## How to Evaluate SEO Value

The cost of SEO should be evaluated against the value of the traffic and leads it generates. Consider the following:

- **Cost per lead:** If you spend $2,000 per month on SEO and generate 20 organic leads, your cost per lead is $100. Compare this to your Google Ads cost per lead.
- **Lifetime customer value:** If the average customer is worth $5,000 over their lifetime, a cost per lead of $100 to $200 represents a strong return.
- **Cumulative value:** Unlike paid advertising, the work done in SEO accumulates over time. Content remains published, technical improvements persist, and links continue to pass authority. The value of SEO compounds over months and years.

## Summary

SEO costs in Australia range from around $1,000 per month for basic local campaigns to $15,000 or more per month for competitive national campaigns. The appropriate investment depends on the industry, geographic scope, current website condition, and business objectives.

The most important factor is not the price itself but whether the provider can clearly explain what work will be done, how results will be measured, and what outcomes are realistic for the given budget.
