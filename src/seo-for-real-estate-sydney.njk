        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How Vendors Find Real Estate Agents Online</h2>
            <p>When someone decides to sell, they often start with Google. "Real estate agent [suburb]", "who sells the most in [area]", "property appraisal [suburb]". The agents who appear in those searches get considered.</p>
            
            <p>Buyers search on Domain and Realestate.com.au. But vendors, the ones who give you listings, search Google. They're researching who to trust with their biggest asset.</p>
            
            <p>Real estate SEO is about appearing when potential vendors in your area search for agents. Not just for your brand name, but for the suburb and service searches that indicate someone is looking to sell.</p>

<!-- What Real Estate SEO Includes Section -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Real Estate SEO Includes</h2>
            
            <h3>Suburb Pages</h3>
            <p>Each suburb you work in deserves its own page. Not just a list of current listings, but actual content about the area, recent sales, and why you're the local expert. These pages target "real estate agent [suburb]" searches.</p>
            
            <h3>Vendor-Focused Content</h3>
            <p>Content that answers vendor questions: "How to prepare my house for sale", "What is my property worth", "When is the best time to sell in Sydney". This captures people considering selling before they've chosen an agent.</p>
            
            <h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
            <p>Your Google listing appears in local searches and Maps. Reviews here matter enormously. I optimise your profile and help you get more reviews from happy vendors.</p>
            
            <h3>Local SEO</h3>
            <p>For agencies with specific geographic focus, local SEO ensures you appear for searches in your area. This includes local citations, consistent business information, and location-based content.</p>
            
            <h3>Agent Profile Pages</h3>
            <p>For individual agents building their personal brand, profile pages that rank for their name and area. This supports referral checking and builds credibility.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Competition Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Real Estate SEO Competition in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Sydney real estate is competitive online. Major agencies have marketing teams and big budgets. But local searches are still winnable.</p>
            
            <p>What matters:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Local focus:</strong> An agency in Paddington competes for Paddington searches, not against every agency in Sydney.</li>
                <li><strong>Content quality:</strong> Generic suburb pages don't rank. Pages with actual local knowledge and recent data do.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> More positive reviews than competitors in your area makes a real difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Regular content and updates signal an active, engaged agency.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The big agencies dominate broad searches like "Sydney real estate agent". But suburb-specific searches are still very winnable for local agencies who invest in proper SEO.</p>

<!-- Pricing Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Real Estate SEO Pricing</h2>
            <p>SEO for real estate agencies starts from $1,500 per month. This includes suburb page creation, Google Business Profile management, content development, and monthly reporting.</p>
            
            <p>Factors affecting pricing:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Number of suburbs you want to target</li>
                <li>Whether you need sales, property management, or both</li>
                <li>Current state of your website and online presence</li>
                <li>Competition level in your area</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Individual agents building personal brands may need less than whole agencies. I assess your specific situation and provide a fixed quote before starting.</p>
            
            <p>No lock-in contracts. Month-to-month with 30 days notice.</p>
