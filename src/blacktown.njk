<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Blacktown and across western Sydney. We've been working with businesses around Main Street, Flushcombe Road, Patrick Street, Richmond Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Blacktown has continued to grow as one of the largest commercial centres in western Sydney with significant investment in the CBD and surrounding infrastructure.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Blacktown is a major commercial hub serving a massive population catchment across the greater Blacktown area. Theres a diverse mix of medical practices, legal firms, migration agents, real estate agencies, trade businesses, retail and hospitality. The multicultural population creates a wide range of search behaviours and service needs. For businesses in Blacktown the search volume is high and the competition online is still moderate compared to what you'd expect for a suburb of this size. Its a market where businesses that invest in SEO can build dominant positions because many competitors are still relying on traditional advertising and word of mouth.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a migration agency near Main Street in mid 2022 that had been operating for about three years. Two registered agents handling skilled visas, partner visas and employer sponsored applications. They were getting most of their clients from community networks and referrals which is where most of their cases had always come from. Their website was a basic template with service descriptions and their Google Business Profile was incomplete. We rebuilt the site with individual visa category pages, created content around specific visa eligibility and processing topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from migration industry directories. Over about seven months their organic enquiries went from about two per month to around ten. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the migration content which a lot of other agencies in western Sydney outsource.</p>

<p>The trade and home services market in Blacktown is substantial. The surrounding suburbs have a large number of houses that need ongoing maintenance and renovation. Electricians, plumbers, builders and landscapers who service the Blacktown area can build a strong pipeline of work through local SEO because the search demand is consistently high across the region.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Blacktown businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For migration agencies and professional services in Blacktown its usually between $1,200 and $1,800 depending on how many visa categories or services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Blacktown business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Blacktown area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
