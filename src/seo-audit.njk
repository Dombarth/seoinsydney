                <h1>SEO Audit</h1>
                <p class="hero-subtitle">An SEO audit is a systematic analysis of a website's technical health, content quality, backlink profile, and keyword positioning. It identifies issues that are limiting search visibility and provides a prioritised roadmap for improvement.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Why an SEO Audit Matters</h2>
            <p>Many websites have technical problems, content gaps, or backlink issues that are silently limiting their search performance. These problems are not always visible to the website owner because they exist at the code level, in the server configuration, or in the backlink profile rather than on the visible pages.</p>
            <p>An SEO audit brings these issues to the surface. It provides a factual baseline of where a website currently stands and what needs to change for rankings to improve.</p>
            <p>This is particularly important if a website has had previous SEO work done. Inherited backlink profiles may contain toxic links, previous content changes may have created duplicate content issues, and technical modifications may have introduced crawl barriers.</p>

<!-- What We Analyse Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What We Analyse</h2>
            <h3>Technical Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>We conduct a full crawl of the website to identify technical issues that affect how search engines discover, access, and index pages. This includes:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Crawl errors, broken links, and redirect chains</li>
                <li>XML sitemap accuracy and robots.txt configuration</li>
                <li>HTTPS implementation and mixed content issues</li>
                <li>Core Web Vitals performance (LCP, INP, CLS)</li>
                <li>Mobile usability and responsive design testing</li>
                <li>Page speed analysis for desktop and mobile</li>
                <li>Structured data validation</li>
                <li>Canonical tag implementation</li>
                <li>Hreflang and language targeting (where applicable)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>On-Page Content</h3>
            <p>We review the content on each important page to assess:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Title tags and meta descriptions — accuracy, length, keyword relevance</li>
                <li>Heading structure — proper H1, H2, H3 hierarchy</li>
                <li>Content depth — whether pages fully address their target topic</li>
                <li>Duplicate content — pages competing for the same keywords</li>
                <li>Thin content — pages with insufficient substance to rank</li>
                <li>Keyword targeting — alignment between content and search intent</li>
                <li>Internal linking — structure and distribution of links between pages</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Backlink Profile</h3>
            <p>We analyse the website's external link profile to assess:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Total referring domains and the quality distribution</li>
                <li>Toxic or spammy backlinks that could trigger penalties</li>
                <li>Anchor text distribution — natural vs over-optimised</li>
                <li>Link velocity — how links are being acquired over time</li>
                <li>Competitor backlink comparison — where competitors have links that you do not</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Keyword Positioning</h3>
            <p>We assess current keyword rankings and identify:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Keywords currently ranking in positions 1-10, 11-20, and 21-100</li>
                <li>Keywords with high impression counts but low click-through rates</li>
                <li>Keyword gaps — terms your competitors rank for that you do not</li>
                <li>Cannibalisation — multiple pages competing for the same keyword</li>
            </ul>
