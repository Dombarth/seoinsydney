<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Granville and across the greater Parramatta area. We've been working with businesses around South Street, Blaxcell Street, Railway Parade and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Granville has been slowly changing as the development around Parramatta pushes outward into neighbouring suburbs.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Granville is a working class suburb with a strong multicultural community and a commercial strip that serves local needs. Theres a mix of automotive businesses, trade services, retail shops, restaurants, medical practices and professional services firms. For businesses in Granville the search volume is solid particularly for trade and service based searches because the local population tends to search for services rather than traveling to other suburbs. Its a suburb where basic local SEO can make a significant difference because most businesses here haven't invested in any online marketing beyond a Facebook page.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a smash repair workshop near Blaxcell Street in early 2022 that had been operating for about twelve years. Three staff handling insurance and private repairs. They were getting most of their work from insurance company panels and repeat customers which is where most of their jobs had always come from. Their website was a free GoDaddy page with no real content and they didn't have a Google Business Profile at all. We built a proper site with service pages for each type of repair, sorted out the GBP with photos of their work and proper categories and built citations across automotive directories. Over about six months their private repair enquiries from organic search went from about one per week to around seven. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the automotive content which a lot of other agencies don't really understand.</p>

<p>The medical services market in Granville is important because the local population relies on nearby practitioners. GPs, dentists, physiotherapists and pharmacies that invest in local SEO can attract new patients who are searching online rather than just walking past. A medical practice in Granville with good local SEO visibility will consistently attract patients from the surrounding suburbs as well.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Granville businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For automotive and trade businesses in Granville its usually between $1,200 and $1,600 depending on how many services and areas are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Granville business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Granville area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
