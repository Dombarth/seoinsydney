<p>At SEO In Sydney we provide SEO services for businesses in Granville and across the surrounding areas of South Granville, Clyde and Merrylands. Granville is a working class commercial hub with a strong mix of automotive businesses, trades, retail and food services along Parramatta Road, Blaxcell Street and the streets around the station.</p>

<p>The automotive and mechanical repair businesses along Parramatta Road are some of the most competitive in western Sydney. Theres probably 30 to 40 mechanics, tyre shops, panel beaters and auto electricians within a few kilometres of Granville station. Most of them have either no website or a basic one that hasn't been touched in years. The ones that invest in even basic local SEO stand out immediately because the bar is so low.</p>

<p>We worked with a mechanic on Parramatta Road who had been in business for over fifteen years. He was well known locally but his online presence was essentially a Facebook page and a GBP that someone had set up years ago with the wrong address. He was losing customers to newer workshops that had better Google visibility despite having less experience. We set up a proper website with service pages for his key offerings — logbook servicing, brake repairs, pre purchase inspections, air conditioning — fixed the GBP, got reviews flowing and built a few links from local directories and automotive associations. Within about four months he was appearing in the map pack for most mechanic related searches in the Granville and Parramatta area. He said the phone started ringing more consistently and he was seeing new faces every week.</p>

<p>For the food and retail businesses around Granville the local customer base is loyal but growth comes from capturing search traffic from people in surrounding suburbs who might not know the area. Local SEO makes these businesses discoverable to a wider audience.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before anything starts. No lock in contracts, month to month with 30 days notice.</p>
