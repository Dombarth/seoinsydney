<h2>The Search Landscape in Granville</h2>

<p>Granville has a different search profile to the nearby Parramatta CBD. The suburb has a stronger presence of trade businesses, automotive services, retail shops and local services rather than the corporate professional services that dominate Parramatta. The multicultural community also shapes the types of businesses and search patterns in the area.</p>

<p>Key search characteristics in Granville:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Trade and automotive businesses along Parramatta Road</li>
    <li>Retail businesses serving the local multicultural community</li>
    <li>Professional services including accountants and migration agents</li>
    <li>Hospitality venues with Middle Eastern, South Asian and other cuisine specialisations</li>
    <li>Overlap with Parramatta and surrounding suburbs for many service searches</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Work in Granville</h2>

<p>We worked with an automotive repair business on Parramatta Road that had been operating for about ten years. They had a solid reputation with existing customers but were not appearing in search results when people in the area searched for car repairs or mechanical services. Their website was a single page with a phone number and address. Over about five months we built a proper site with pages for each type of service they offered, optimised their Google Business Profile with correct automotive categories and service areas covering the suburbs they served, and built citations across automotive and business directories. They started receiving a steady flow of new customer enquiries through search.</p>

<p>For retail businesses along South Street, Google Business Profile optimisation is the most immediate lever. The commercial strip serves a local customer base, and visibility in the map pack helps capture people searching for specific products and services in the Granville area.</p>

    <li>Technical SEO audits and implementation</li>
    <li>Google Business Profile setup and service area management</li>
    <li>On-page optimisation for service pages</li>

    <li>Link building from relevant trade, automotive and local sources</li>

</ul>
