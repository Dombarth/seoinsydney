<p>At SEO In Sydney we work with businesses in Miranda and the central Sutherland Shire. Miranda is the main retail and commercial hub of the Shire thanks to Westfield Miranda which is one of the largest shopping centres in southern Sydney. The area along Kingsway, Kiora Road and the streets surrounding the Westfield supports a significant number of medical practices, dental clinics, professional services firms and retail businesses.</p>

<p>The medical and dental market around Miranda is one of the most competitive in the Shire. The proximity to Westfield and the Miranda Medical Centre has attracted a high concentration of healthcare providers. Dentists, physiotherapists, psychologists, GPs and specialists are all competing for the same local patient searches. In this type of market SEO isn't optional — its the difference between a full appointment book and empty chairs.</p>

<p>We started working with a psychology practice near Miranda station in 2023. They had two psychologists and were getting referrals from GPs and EAP programs but wanted to build their private client base. Their website was a single page with their qualifications and contact details. We built a proper website with pages for each area of practice — anxiety, depression, couples therapy, workplace stress, adolescent psychology — optimised the GBP and built links from psychology associations and health directories. Within about six months they were appearing in search results for psychology and counselling searches across the Sutherland Shire. Their private client enquiries from organic search went from almost zero to about six per week. They had to open a waitlist which was a problem they were happy to have.</p>

<p>For the retail businesses around Miranda the competition with the Westfield tenants is real. But independent businesses that rank well in local search capture customers who are specifically looking for alternatives to chain stores.</p>

<p>Local SEO from $1,200 per month. Written quote before we start. No lock in contracts, month to month.</p>
