<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Miranda and across the Sutherland Shire. We've been working with businesses around The Kingsway, Kiora Road, Wandella Road and the surrounding areas since about 2018 and Miranda has continued to grow as the main retail and services hub of the Shire with Westfield Miranda anchoring the commercial centre.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Miranda is the commercial centre of the Sutherland Shire with a large concentration of medical specialists, dental practices, professional services firms and retail businesses clustered around the Westfield precinct and The Kingsway. The Miranda Medical Centre and surrounding specialist suites attract patients from across the entire Shire. For businesses in Miranda the search volume is strong because the suburb serves as a destination for the broader Shire population. Its a market where medical and professional services can build substantial patient and client bases through local SEO because Miranda is where people go when they need something beyond what their local suburb offers.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a cosmetic dentistry practice near Kiora Road in mid 2021 that had been operating for about six years. Two dentists specialising in veneers, whitening and smile makeovers. They were getting most of their patients from social media advertising and referrals which is where most of their consultations had always come from. Their website had treatment pages but they were thin on content and weren't ranking for any cosmetic dentistry searches in the Shire. We rebuilt the content with detailed procedure pages, created before and after case study sections, sorted out the Google Business Profile and built links from dental directories and cosmetic industry publications. Over about eight months their organic consultation bookings went from about two per month to around ten. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the dental content which a lot of other agencies in the Sutherland Shire outsource.</p>

<p>The retail market around Miranda is dominated by Westfield but the independent businesses on The Kingsway and surrounding streets can compete on local searches. A specialist retailer or service business in Miranda that invests in local SEO captures the searches that big chain stores don't target because they rely on their national marketing presence.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Miranda businesses start from $1,200 per month. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, one piece of content per month, citation building, and monthly reporting. For dental practices and medical specialists in Miranda its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many treatments and services are being targeted. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your Miranda business gets proper attention. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Miranda area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
