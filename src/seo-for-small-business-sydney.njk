            <h2>SEO That Works for Small Businesses</h2>
            <p>Small businesses don't have corporate marketing budgets. You need SEO that actually works without costing a fortune. I keep things practical and focused on what matters for your business.</p>
            
            <p>What that means:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Focus on local:</strong> Most small businesses serve specific areas. Local SEO targets the people who can actually become customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple websites work:</strong> You don't need a massive website. You need the right pages, with the right content, that work well on mobile.</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic timelines:</strong> I tell you honestly how long things take. No promises of instant results, but steady progress you can see.</li>
                <li><strong>Month-to-month:</strong> No lock-in contracts. You stay because you're getting results, not because you're trapped.</li>
            </ul>

<!-- What Small Business SEO Includes Section -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Small Business SEO Includes</h2>
            
            <h3>Google Business Profile</h3>
            <p>For local businesses, this is often the most important thing. Your Google listing appears in Maps and local search results. I set it up properly, optimise it, and help you get reviews.</p>
            
            <h3>Local SEO</h3>
            <p>Appearing when people in your area search for what you do. A cafe in Newtown wants to appear for "cafe Newtown", not compete with every cafe in Sydney.</p>
            
            <h3>Service Pages</h3>
            <p>Pages for each main service you offer. These capture searches for specific services and explain what you do. A mechanic might have pages for "log book servicing", "brake repair", "air conditioning regas".</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Basics</h3>
            <p>Site speed, mobile usability, and making sure search engines can find your pages. You don't need a perfect website, but you need one that works.</p>
            
            <h3>Content That Answers Questions</h3>
            <p>Pages answering common customer questions capture research-stage searches and build trust. "How much does X cost", "How long does X take", "What's the difference between X and Y".</p>
