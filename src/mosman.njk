Pricing depends on competition level and keyword scope. Written quote provided before work begins."
  - q: "How long before SEO produces results here?"
    a: "Most local businesses see measurable ranking improvements within three to six months. The 2088 postcode has moderate competition for local service searches. Health, beauty, and hospitality categories are the most competitive sectors in the area."
  - q: "Do you work with businesses outside the area?"
    a: "Yes. I work with businesses across the lower North Shore including Neutral Bay, Cremorne, North Sydney, and all suburbs across the Sydney metropolitan area. The approach is tailored to the specific search landscape of each area."
  - q: "Is there a lock-in contract?"
    a: "No. All campaigns are month to month with 30 days notice. I recommend a minimum of six months because SEO results compound over time, but there is no lock-in of any kind. If you stop, everything stays yours."

<h2>Why Local SEO Matters</h2>

<p>The area is a lower North Shore suburb within the 2088 postcode, bordered by Sydney Harbour to the south and Middle Harbour to the east. The suburb has two primary commercial centres: the Village on Military Road and Spit Junction at the intersection of Military Road and Spit Road. Taronga Zoo is the most recognised landmark in the area, drawing visitors via ferry from Circular Quay. Balmoral Beach on the harbour foreshore is a popular local destination with its own cluster of restaurants and cafes. The suburb is predominantly residential with a high median property value, and the local commercial areas serve an affluent demographic.</p>

<p>The area's commercial profile reflects its residential character. Boutique retail, health and wellness services, beauty salons, dining establishments, and professional services cater to the local population. The peninsula geography of the area creates a self-contained local market where residents prefer to access services within their immediate area. This means businesses with strong local search visibility capture a disproportionate share of enquiries from the area residential catchment. The high customer lifetime value in the area makes the return on SEO investment particularly favourable for service businesses.</p>

<h2>Cost and Structure</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for local businesses start from $1,200 per month. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. Everything stays yours if you decide to leave. I manage each campaign directly with no handoffs to junior staff or offshore teams.</p>
