<h2>The Search Landscape in Mosman</h2>

<p>Mosman's commercial activity is concentrated in two areas: the Mosman village precinct around Mosman Square and the Spit Junction strip along Military Road. The business mix reflects the affluent residential population, with a concentration of health practitioners, premium dining, boutique retail and professional services.</p>

    <li>Premium hospitality venues in the village and harbourside areas</li>

<h2>How We Work in Mosman</h2>

<p>We worked with a physiotherapy practice near Mosman Square that had two physiotherapists and a patient base built through local GP referrals. Their website was functional but had not been updated in several years and had no individual treatment pages. Over about four months we restructured the site with pages for each treatment type and common condition, optimised their Google Business Profile and built citations across health and physiotherapy directories. The practice started appearing in local search results and receiving new patient enquiries from residents who were searching for specific treatment types.</p>

<p>For hospitality businesses in Mosman village, Google Business Profile optimisation and local search visibility help capture dining searches from residents and visitors. The competition is less intense than in larger commercial centres, which means consistent local SEO work can produce meaningful results.</p>
