<p>At SEO In Sydney we specialise in the areas of search engine optimisation for businesses in Mosman and across the lower north shore. We've been working with businesses along Military Road, Avenue Road, Spit Junction, Beauty Point Road and the surrounding areas since about 2017 and Mosman has always been a suburb that attracts businesses catering to a discerning clientele.</p>

<p>We work month to month with no lock in contracts and our local SEO campaigns start from $1,200 per month. All work is done in house by our Sydney based team.</p>

<p>Mosman is one of Sydneys wealthiest suburbs and the commercial centres around Spit Junction and Military Road reflect that. Theres a concentration of high end real estate agencies, medical specialists, boutique retail, premium dining, private schools and professional services firms. For businesses in Mosman the customer base has high expectations and strong purchasing power. Its a suburb where your online presence directly impacts trust and the quality of your website and Google presence can make or break a first impression because Mosman residents research thoroughly before engaging a service provider.</p>

<h2>How It Works Here</h2>

<p>We took on a private GP practice near Avenue Road in mid 2021 that had been operating for about fourteen years. Three GPs offering comprehensive family medicine with a focus on preventive health. They were getting most of their new patients from word of mouth and their existing patient referrals which is where most of their bookings had always come from. Their website was an outdated template with no health content and their Google Business Profile had minimal information. We rebuilt the site with individual health topic pages, created content around preventive health, chronic disease management and family medicine topics, sorted out the GBP and built links from medical directories and GP associations. Over about eight months their new patient registrations from organic search went from about two per month to around nine. The team at SEO In Sydney handle all of that in house including the medical content which a lot of other agencies in Mosman outsource to generic writers.</p>

<p>The real estate market in Mosman is premium and highly competitive. Agencies compete aggressively for vendor listings and the ones that rank well for Mosman property market content and suburb guides tend to build authority with potential sellers. A real estate agency in Mosman that invests in SEO for suburb specific content can position itself as the local market expert.</p>

<h2>What It Costs</h2>

<p>Local SEO campaigns for Mosman businesses start from $1,200 per month. For medical practices and professional services firms in Mosman its usually between $1,500 and $2,200 depending on how many services are being targeted. That covers on page work, Google Business Profile management, content, link building, and monthly reporting. Written quote with a full breakdown before anything starts. No setup fees.</p>

<h2>No Contracts</h2>

<p>Month to month. 30 days notice. If you decide to leave everything stays yours. Content, backlinks, technical fixes. The team at SEO In Sydney have been working this way since day one and we've kept the majority of our Mosman clients without needing a lock in agreement. As such we don't see the need for one while still delivering the highest standard of quality service each month.</p>

<p>Each of our specialists handles no more than fifteen accounts at a time so your business gets proper attention. I review every Mosman strategy personally before it goes out.</p>

<h2>Free Audit</h2>

<p>We'll do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors in the Mosman area. Its a written report not a sales pitch.</p>
