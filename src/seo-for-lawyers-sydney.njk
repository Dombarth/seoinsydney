    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>How Clients Find Lawyers Online</h2>
            <p>When someone needs a lawyer, they usually start with Google. The search might be practice-specific like "family lawyer Sydney" or "criminal lawyer Parramatta". It might be problem-based like "divorce lawyer near me" or "what happens if I get a DUI".</p>
            
            <p>The firms that appear in those searches get the enquiries. The ones that don't appear, miss out. Even referrals often Google the firm name first to check them out.</p>
            
            <p>Legal SEO is about appearing when potential clients search for the legal services you offer. Not just for your firm name, but for the practice areas and problems you solve.</p>

<!-- What Legal SEO Includes Section -->
<section class="content-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>What Legal SEO Includes</h2>
            
            <h3>Practice Area Pages</h3>
            <p>Each practice area needs its own page. Family law, criminal law, commercial litigation. These pages should explain what you do, who you help, and what to expect. They target searches like "family lawyer Sydney" and "commercial litigation firm".</p>
            
            <h3>Problem-Based Content</h3>
            <p>Clients search for problems, not just practice areas. "How to file for divorce in Australia", "what are my rights if I'm fired", "contesting a will NSW". Content answering these questions captures clients at the research stage and builds trust before they contact you.</p>
            
            <h3>Local SEO</h3>
            <p>For firms serving specific areas, local SEO helps you appear in location-based searches. A firm in Parramatta wants to appear for "lawyer Parramatta". A CBD firm might target broader Sydney searches. I optimise for the geographic reach you actually serve.</p>
            
            <h3>Authority Building</h3>
            <p>Legal SEO requires authority. Links from legal directories, industry publications, and relevant websites signal that your firm is credible. I build links through legitimate outreach and content, not spammy tactics that risk your reputation.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
            <p>Site speed, mobile usability, and technical issues affect rankings. Legal websites often have large amounts of content that needs proper structure. I fix technical problems and ensure search engines can find and understand all your pages.</p>

<!-- Competition Section -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Legal SEO Competition in Sydney</h2>
            <p>Legal is one of the most competitive industries for SEO. Many firms have been investing in SEO for years. Large firms have marketing teams and big budgets. But that doesn't mean smaller firms can't compete.</p>
            
            <p>What matters:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Practice area focus:</strong> A firm specialising in family law can outrank generalist firms for family law searches by having deeper, more relevant content.</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> A firm in North Sydney competes with other North Sydney firms for local searches, not every firm in Sydney.</li>
                <li><strong>Content quality:</strong> Generic content doesn't rank well. Detailed, helpful content that actually answers questions does.</li>
                <li><strong>Authority:</strong> Quality links from legal and business sources matter more than quantity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I research your specific competitive landscape and build a strategy around realistic opportunities.</p>
