Bathroom tiling Allawah

## Example 2: "I" Solo Style - Tiler (100% Human)

```
Finding water leaks and repairing them correctly, not just covering the problem with a quick patch like silicone. This week alone, I have had 3 emergency calls water leaking through the ceilings. The average time for us to get here was 40 minutes.

If you are going to renovate your bathroom then I believe the most important part is to waterproof it correctly. Instead of using DIY waterproofing methods which can wear out easily, I use proper membrane systems from industry leaders such as Mapei, Ardex or Davco.

16 years experience in tiling Sydney homes. I am familiar with every issue there is and know the solution for each. From heritage terraces in Balmain to new builds in Rouse Hill.

All my quotes cover waterproofing, materials, labour, and waste removal, with no hidden charges. The average cost of a bathroom is $2, 850, while a kitchen splashback costs around $480.

I have taken out full insurance and provide warranty for all my work. The dull details that no one wants to hear but are there when you need them.

I am punctual. I answer my calls. I fix issues. It may sound like basic things but surprisingly they are not typical in Sydney tiling industry.

Most of my work comes through word, of, mouth. If you do good work, people tell their friends about you. Its as simple as that.

If a typical bathroom renovation costs $2, 850, then I would do it for that price. A 2.5m x 2m bathroom in Chatswood took three days and cost $2, 850 in total. The price was for all services tearing down the old tiles, waterproofing, installing new tiles, grouting, silicone, and waste disposal.

Generally, kitchen splashbacks cost somewhere between $450 and $550. In Penrith, I tiled a kitchen with 4 square metres of subway tiles. I began at 8 in the morning, and the customer was having dinner in the kitchen at night. The total cost was $480.

Floor tiling prices depend on the kind of room. For large scale floor tiling jobs, I charge $40, 55 per square metre. For small jobs it is a $280 minimum charge as I must consider the time needed to travel to the site and the costs of materials for the repair.

There is no requirement for an upfront payment when it comes to insurance jobs. I am registered with NRMA, Allianz, and QBE. This year I have done 47 insurance jobs. Since they know I do the work correctly insurance claims get approved fast.

Need SEO help in Sydney?

I am Dom. 12 years experience doing SEO for Sydney businesses. I am familiar with every issue there is when it comes to ranking websites in this market and know the solution for each. From law firms in the CBD to tradies in Western Sydney to ecommerce stores selling nationally.

If you are going to invest in SEO then I believe the most important part is knowing exactly who is doing the work on your website. Instead of using agencies that outsource everything offshore or hand you off to a junior account manager, I do the work myself and you deal with me directly.

Why Most SEO Campaigns Fail in Sydney

There is a pattern I see over and over with Sydney businesses. They have either done nothing or they have been with an agency that sends offshore content and buys links from private blog networks. The monthly reports look impressive with traffic graphs and keyword charts but when you dig into the numbers there are no actual leads or sales coming through.

I took on a plumbing company in the inner west in early 2022 that had been paying another agency $2, 000 a month for about eighteen months with nothing to show for it. Their website had about 40 spammy backlinks from offshore directories, the Google Business Profile was using the wrong categories and the site itself was a five page WordPress template with no service pages.

I cleaned up the backlink profile, rebuilt the site with proper service and location pages, sorted out the GBP and built links from trade directories and local business associations. About eight months in they were getting 30 to 40 organic enquiries a month which is where most of their new work now comes from. They are still with me three years later.

The cleanup work is sometimes as important as the new optimisation. I do a backlink audit before I start any campaign and if there is toxic links I deal with those first before building anything new.

Sydney Is Competitive

Sydney is a competitive market and every suburb has its own dynamics when it comes to search. A dentist in Bondi Junction is fighting 25 other practices within a few kilometres for three map positions. An accountant in Parramatta is competing against firms that have been investing in SEO for three or four years already. A tradie in the inner west needs to show up for near me searches and half the time they dont even have a Google Business Profile set up properly.

I have worked across most of these industries and most of these areas. The approach is always built around what the business actually needs rather than a template. Its as simple as that.

What Makes Me Different

Most SEO agencies in Sydney operate the same way. Sales person signs you up. Account manager sends you reports. Offshore team does the actual work. Nobody you talk to is the person doing your SEO.

I work differently.

You deal with me. I do the work. I write the reports. I answer the phone when you call. I manage no more than fifteen accounts at a time because I actually want to get results for each one rather than just collecting monthly fees.

At larger agencies it is common for a single account manager to be handling forty or fifty clients which means your website gets a few hours of attention per month at best. That is not how you get results.

All work is done by my Sydney based team. I dont send work offshore. I review every strategy personally before it goes out.

What You Get Each Month

All my reports cover exactly what work was carried out, with no hidden metrics or confusing dashboards. Not a dashboard with traffic graphs and no context. An actual written report covering keyword research, on page changes, link building, content work and technical SEO.

I break down how many hours were spent on each task and what the results were. This is something a lot of agencies in this area dont bother doing.

If your organic traffic went up I tell you why. If it didnt I tell you that as well.

I handle on page SEO, technical SEO, content creation, link building, Google Business Profile optimisation, citation management and monthly reporting. Same tools as everyone else. Google Search Console, Ahrefs, Semrush, Screaming Frog. I dont have proprietary AI technology. I just do the work properly.

Services

Technical SEO: Site speed, mobile, crawlability, indexation issues. The dull details that no one wants to hear but are there when you need them.

Local SEO: Google Business Profile, maps, local search visibility. If you are going to rank in the map pack then I believe the most important part is getting your GBP set up correctly.

Content SEO: Content strategy, keyword targeting, service pages. I write content that ranks and converts.

AEO and GEO: AI search visibility, featured snippets, answer engines. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity are changing how people search. I make sure your business shows up in AI generated answers not just traditional Google results.

Link Building: High quality backlinks from real Australian websites. I dont use PBNs or offshore link farms that will get you penalised down the track.

Different Businesses Need Different Approaches

For local service businesses across Sydney the Google Business Profile is usually the first priority. Map pack visibility drives more phone calls than organic results for most trades and local services.

For ecommerce it is different. It is more about product page optimisation, category structure, site speed and building authority with relevant links.

For professional services firms it is usually a combination of local SEO and content that positions them for the specific services they want to be known for.

I handle all of these differently because they require different approaches and different timelines. I only take one client per industry in each area so I am never competing against myself.

What It Costs

All my campaigns cover keyword research and competitor analysis, on page optimisation, technical SEO, link building from relevant Australian sources, content writing for your website, Google Business Profile management, and monthly report with full breakdown of work and results, with no hidden charges.

Local SEO: From $1, 200 per month
National and ecommerce: From $2, 000 per month
No setup fees
No lock in contracts: Month to month, 30 days notice
Free SEO audit before you commit to anything

Written quote with full breakdown before I start. The average cost depends on competition level, number of keywords and how much content and link building is required. Every quote is different but I am transparent about what each dollar goes toward.

No Contracts

Month to month. 30 days notice. No lock in contracts of any kind. Over 90% of my clients stay with me long term without a contract which says more than any sales pitch while still giving you the flexibility to leave whenever you need to.

If you stop everything stays yours. Content I have written stays on your website. Technical improvements stay in place. Backlinks I have built dont get removed. I dont hold anything hostage.

Industries I Work With

I am familiar with every issue there is in these industries and know the solution for each:

Professional Services: Lawyers, accountants, financial planners, consultants
Trades and Construction: Plumbers, electricians, builders, tilers, roofers
Healthcare: Dentists, physios, chiropractors, specialists, medical centres
Ecommerce: Online stores, retail, wholesale, dropshipping
Hospitality: Restaurants, cafes, bars, hotels, venues
B2B: Software, manufacturing, wholesale, services

Each campaign is tailored to the buying behaviour and search patterns of your market. I only take one client per industry in each geographic area.

Free Audit

I will do a free audit of your website covering technical health, backlinks and how you compare against your main competitors. It is a written report not a sales pitch. I send it through and you can decide from there whether it is worth having a conversation about what I can do.

Most of my work comes through word, of, mouth. If you do good work, people tell their friends about you. Its as simple as that.

I am punctual with deadlines. I answer my calls. I fix issues. It may sound like basic things but surprisingly they are not typical in Sydney SEO industry.
